"If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. 

The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.",-1
"I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out.

For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do).

There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!",1
"Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations. Next to the Clarion Hotel.",1
"Wow!  Yummy, different,  delicious.   Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma.  With 10 different kinds of naan!!!  Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!   You'll be glad you did!",1
"Cute interior and owner (?) gave us tour of upcoming patio/rooftop area which will be great on beautiful days like today. Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails. Next time I will try one of the draft wines.",1
I am a long term frequent customer of this establishment. I just went in to order take out (3 apps) and was told they're too busy to do it. Really? The place is maybe half full at best. Does your dick reach your ass? Yes? Go fuck yourself! I'm a frequent customer AND great tipper. Glad that Kanella just opened. NEVER going back to dmitris!,-1
"Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who'd never been there before and didn't know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You'll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it's not terribly hard to find, and it'll give you a chance to get some water), and you'll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!",1
"Amazingly amazing wings and homemade bleu cheese. Had the ribeye: tender, perfectly prepared, delicious. Nice selection of craft beers. Would DEFINITELY recommend checking out this hidden gem.",1
This easter instead of going to Lopez Lake we went to Los Padres National Forest which is really pretty but if you go to white rock the staff needs to cut down all the dead grass that invades the rock and the water. I would wish the staff would also clean or get rid of the dead grass that's also living by the water. The water is really green and dirty. Los padres national forest staff need to work hard to maintain this forest looking pretty and not like a dumpster. Even Cachuma lake looks like they put a bit more effort.,-1
"Had a party of 6 here for hibachi. Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.",-1
"My experience with Shalimar was nothing but wonderful. 
I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It's very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should've gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!
The associates' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience.",1
"Locals recommended Milktooth, and it's an amazing jewel of Indianapolis. I'm glade I had the chance to experience this.",1
Love going here for happy hour or dinner!  Great patio with fans to beat the StL heat!   Also...very accomodating at this location.  I like the Veal Milanese but with mixed greens instead of pasta!  they'll modify the menu to suit your taste!,1
"Good food--loved the gnocchi with marinara
the baked eggplant appetizer was very good too

The service was very slow, but despite this, I'd go back, the food is just that good",1
"The bun makes the Sonoran Dog. It's like a snuggie for the pup. A first, it seems ridiculous and almost like it's going to be too much, exactly like everyone's favorite blanket with sleeves. Too much softness, too much smush, too indulgent.  Wrong. It's warm, soft, chewy, fragrant, and it succeeds where other famed Sonoran Dogs fail. 

The hot dog itself is flavorful, but I would prefer that it or the bacon have a little more bite or snap to better hold their own against the dominant mustard and onions. 

I'm with the masses on the carne asada caramelo. Excellent tortilla, salty, melty cheese, and great carne. 

Super cheap and you can drive through.",1
"Great place for breakfast! I had the waffle, which was fluffy and perfect, and home fries which were nice and smashed and crunchy. Friendly waitstaff. Will definitely be back!",1
"Tremendous service (Big shout out to Douglas) that complemented the delicious food. Pretty expensive establishment (40-50$ avg for your main course), but its definitely backs that up with an atmosphere that's comparable with any of the top tier restaurants across the country.",1
"The hubby and I have been here on multiple occasions and we have loved every part of the meal, every single time. Everyone from the servers to the bartender is very knowledgable about the menu and was able to immediately recommend items I could eat as-is, substitute or delete to make something safe for this Celiac girl to eat. The wine and cocktail menus are spot on. The food divine.  My only wish is that they would have a gluten-free dessert, we've always had to go elsewhere for something sweet. But that is not a big deal and I still want to go here time and time again.",1
"I go to blow bar to get my brows done by natalie (brow specialist) which i highly recommend she is great does a great job on my eyebrows! But then i got a blow by victoria!! Wow i was impress i have thin, straight, dead hair and she left me with the biggest volume ive ever had!!! Tried another girl but didnt like it as much so victoria will be my girl for ever; very beautiful clean place!!!",1
"My absolute favorite cafe in the city. Their black and white latte is probably the best I've ever had (not too sweet and just the right amount of foam), soups are always really good (even for non-soup people) and there's just a lot of space to do work. The noise level is perfect, the music is at a perfect level, and I always enjoy when patrons bring their dogs. I'll keep giving them my business for as long as I can.",1
"HOLY SMOKES!

actual pumpkin pie mixed in with the frozen custard......are you kidding me? Why hasn't this become a huge sweep the nation treat. 

The best part was the chunks of pie crust. Like finding a diamond inside another diamond. Super yummy.",1
"Upland is a brewery based out of Bloomington, Indiana that has become popular enough to open up a couple additional locations in central Indiana.  All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don't think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland's pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I'll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits.",1
I thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Chill way to spend a Friday night.,1
"Yes, this is the only sushi place in town. However, it is great when you're craving sushi and don't have time to go somewhere else. The salmon is probably the best fish they have, so we always order salmon. We also love their spicy edamame, tempura, ocean salad, and cabbage salad. Service has always been friendly and quick!",1
"I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.
The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",1
Went for lunch. Beef brisket sandwich was awesome.   So juicy and tender.    Pulled pork was was just as good!,1
Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.,1
"Service was crappy, and food was mediocre.  I wish I would have picked some other place for my last dinner in town.",-1
"I recently had dinner here with my wife over the weekend and could not have been more pleased! 

Our meal was excellent! My wife and I were astounded by how quickly our food came out! Everything tasted fresh and homemade which we both appreciated. 

The only problem was trying to pick something from the menu as there were too many delicious sounding items to choose from. We will definitely be returning to try more items! Can't wait to see what the next chef specials will be!",1
"I at least have to give this restaurant two stars due to the decent food. But while on a dinner meeting and after spending $100 on entrées and appetizers, I had to flag down the assistant cook, (the guy in bright red baggy pants watching TV), to see if I could get more avocado for my tuna entrée.  He made it very apparent and direct that he could not help me with that situation and I would have to flag down my  waitress so she could bill me for the four dollar avocado.",-1
First time there and it was excellent!!! It feels like your are entering someone's home. The waiters there funny and nice. The food come out very quickly and it is phenomenal!!! Definitely will be going back to this place.,1
"Great burgers,fries and salad!  Burgers have a hint of salt and pepper flavor.

This location is very quaint. They only have outdoor seating

Friendly staff.

Street parking as well as parking lot in the back.",1
Great staff always helps and always nice. Always clean and huge store size. Stays stocked with everything you need. The staff always helps make my custom breakfast bagel,1
"Took my vehicle here for some work a few years ago for a manufacturer recall. Problem went away and then started hearing another noise which I thought was related, but turned out was a completely different issue. Kevin and his mechanic lifted my car right up and fixed the issue FREE OF CHARGE even though I told them I'd pay. Outstanding individuals for doing that. Highly recommend!",1
"After my ROTD  yesterday of a different Sweet CeCe's location, I realized that I had never reviewed my local source!  Anyway, I love the product.  Love love love.  And I usually like their selection of toppings - good mix between healthy and not-so-healthy.  Sometimes the girls working there aren't really paying attention or are nowhere to be found.  Sometimes you have to remind them of their deals (like $5 Friday).  But I can't give it less than 4 stars because I just love it so much.",1
"What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",1
Nice relaxing place to get a massage! Same day appointments are easy to come by! I have never been disappointed with any therapist I have had at the Center!,1
"We checked in around 2:30 pm.  Check-in was quick and easy with complimentary valet parking (always appreciated).  The Peppermill is huge and reminded us of the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.  They have around eight restaurants on site offering almost any type of food you could want.  The casino area is huge, rivaling almost anything you could find in Las Vegas.  One thing we noticed is that many of the slot machines were noted as being penny machines, but when you actually started to play them you realized they had minimum bets of anywhere from 30 cents to $5.  Talk about false advertising!  We were in the Tuscany Tower on the 12th floor.  Our room had a nice view of the huge pool area.  Our room was large and featured free WiFi (likewise always appreciated), a huge bathroom area with large shower (with two shower heads), TV, a large jetted bathtub and a phone next to the commode.  There were dual sinks and lots of counter space.  Plenty of towels were supplied.  The roomy main area had a king bed with night stands, closet, TV, mini fridge, dresser with two drawers, a safe, table for computer or writing, complimentary bottles of water, and three nicely upholstered chairs and table.  The thermostat did a good job controlling the temperature and keeping it comfortable.  Staff were all courteous and helpful.  A very nice place and we enjoyed our stay.",1
"My boyfriend and I tried this deli for the first time today. I had a turkey, avocado & bacon panini and he ha a buffalo chicken wrap. We will definitely be returning. The wait for food wasn't too long, which is always appreciated during lunch hour. There was SO much to choose from. They have salads, soup, macaroni, sandwiches and hot food. I love a deli that has many options to choose from!",1
Amazing biscuits and (fill in the blank). Great cocktails too. Highly recommended. A bit busy though.,1
Food was good- atmosphere/decor is like a fishing lodge- menu is someplace between outback & bonefish. Went on a Groupon & all 3 of our meals & calamari appetizer that we ordered were cooked perfectly- we will def be back.,1
"Straight to the point, it's cheap, it tastes and feels cheap

The good: price, location, dessert (edible food items are: baked chicken, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Salad bar lol, meat and cheese bar, ravioli, pizza) also our waitress was bomb af

The meh: behind counter meat slicing station, shrimp (not even deveined), Mexican station

The bad: breakfast -worst eggs ever, actually worst, eggs. Le Benedict can't even cut through ham or English muffin (tried on all 3 occasions), steak, shrimp again, hell breaded items can't even, don't even. Decor it's the 1970 nightmare you can imagine

Tried 3 times and failed",-1
"The only reason I didn't give this restaurant a 5 star rating, is because of one single pretentious waiter. As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we'd only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me ""I guess it would be fine"" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the ""couldn't be bothered"" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring ""last nights waiter"" wasn't on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. 
I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience.",1
"Stopped by after a Sunday morning walk in the park - great food, coffee customer service - love the vibe in here",1
"In a word... ""OVERRATED!"".  The food took forever to come out.  The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.  It was not horrible, but for everything that we had heard about this place, I would have expected much better.",-1
"Comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast internet, great location, and low price. Overall I was really impressed with this place. However, if you stay on the top floors you may be waiting up to 15 minutes for an elevator in the morning.",1
"NEVER AGAIN. This is a so called restaurant that does nothing that a restaurant should other than prepare food, because the rest is done by the patron. Want water? Get up and go across the yard to get it. Want a drink, walk up a flight of stairs and pay cash. Want to sit in a dirty yard in dirty lawn chairs, enjoy yourself. The wait staff is mildy helpful in that they bring you your food after you go to the window and pay cash for it...kind of like New Orleans Hamburger and Seafood, but dirty and with live music (which is nice). It's a one in a lifetime experience for me...just once.",-1
"If you want to pay for everything a la carte this is the place for you.  
Food wasn't terrible not impressive.
They brought a basket of chips and some tomato sauce which I asked politely for something spicier and some pico de gallo.  She brought them happily to me and the salsa was much better.  When asked what we would like to drink I asked for a coke and she brought out a bottle which I stated I wanted the fountain drink.  She said ""oh that's only Pepsi"".  Never mentioned that they only had bottle drinks for coke.  
We ordered our food which was reasonably priced, asked for sour cream and also to put cheese on the taco.  She let us know cheese was extra.  
It was $2.50 extra for another basket of chips.  
When I received the bill we paid more for the condiments then the actual food.  Side of sour cream 2.00, pico de gallo 2.50, salsa 2.00, chips 2.50, cheese 1.00 and the bottled coke that we didn't want 5.00.  
Just a suggestion...when you order anything make sure to ask if there is an extra charge.",-1
The cafe was extremely cute. We came at 8am and they even had a jazz band playing at that time. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. I loved how they rolled the egg and put the bacon pieces inside. Great price for a filling breakfast!,1
"On a scale of one to things that are awesome, this place is the bomb. 

I was drawn in by the promise of the duckfat frenchfries. Took the boy for his birthday and put our name in, had a drink around the corner while we waited and were given seats at the bar after about 45 minutes. 

We were waited on by Keith, the bartender, who was congenial, knowledgeable about his whiskeys and an all-around cool guy. We started with 3 cape may salts (two for me, one for the boy) and tater tots, both of which made me happy.

For dinner, I got Kentucky Fried Quail (stellar, though the succotash was not as exciting as I wanted it to be) and the boy got the 24$ Fois Gras burger, which was incredible. Worth every penny. The duckfat fries were pretty yummy, but not even the best part of the meal. I could've done without the cheese sauce, but as it was on the side I wasn't deterred.

I look forward to coming back here, with everyone I know.",1
"We started with the artichoke dip, big mistake. It was cold and the chips were stale. Mentioned to our waitress, but nothing came of it.  We ordered a large pizza, thin crust which after adding toppings it was a bit pricey for pizza.  Pizza was ok, not great. Except for not being our advocate our server was good.  I have been here before for Cardinals game, it was better then. Will try another venue next time.",1
"It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back.",1
"I absolutely love Courtney! She is hands down the best hairstylist I have ever had. The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don't have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best.",1
"I've been to this location many times when I lived in the area and although it is a chain and not exactly sexy, it does the job on many occasions.   If you need an oil change, this place is ok, if you need a state inspection this place does it.   The key is getting there when they are not busy or else you will wait.   

Again, nothing fancy here a pep boys is a pep boys but all in all decent stuff.",1
Replaced 2 old 70s lennox with 2 new ones.  They did a great job and have been runnong for 3 years now.,1
"I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.  

Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.  

Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.  

My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.  

Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",1
"Farmhouse, rustic, chic.Helpful staff with great ideas to decorate your home. Prices reasonable. Store has items from Joanna Gaines ( Fixer Upper) and much more. Finally a good home store in SB with reasonable prices.",1
"My brother came to visit and we wanted to pick up a six pack of good beers for a night in. Ended up staying and having a few while playing their Nintendo 64 (Super Smash Brothers, which the owner said was donated by fellow patrons). It's a great place with good food and genuinely nice people. Should be a staple in the Northeast.",1
"My go to menu is coconut soup and pad thai with protein. I tried same menu here. 
Actually really like their coconut soup. They used enough amount of coconut milk that soup was really creamy and wasn't over powering with herb. I am so used to Americanized thai cuisine that I prefer less herb on my dish except cilantro.
Pat thai was great too. Liked the amount of peanut they used, noodle was chewy and perfect and not too sweet. They gave me generous amount of chicken and white meat wasn't dry so I was very happy with my meal.",1
Excellent service! Great diner food and breakfast is served all day. Came here for lunch- they were busy but very friendly and hospitable. Easy to get to off the 295.,1
"My go-to spot on a Saturday night! I was real bummed that lucys closed, but was pleasantly surprised by this bar just across the street!
Their food is better than expected. I always get wings and fries. (be careful of the wtf sauce though) Sometimes it takes a real long time to get the bartenders attention, but the place is usually packed. And if you're lucky the always sunny crew will pop in!",1
"We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.",1
"I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of ""tree huggers"" and ""earth children"", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",1
Honestly the food doesn't knock my socks off but other people seem to love this place. I go because my husband likes it as for me I'd rather go to a different BBQ spot. I guess it also depends on what you order.,-1
"The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.",-1
I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!,1
"I've only had the cannolis here but they are awesome! They're freshly filled when ordered and the filling is phenomenal. Not too sweet, it's perfect. If you like cannoli, if you don't think you like cannoli, you should definitely get one from Termini Bros.",1
"Traveling through in our RV, stopped over in Granite City. Found this little gem of a cafe. Upon entering, the staff was very sweet and friendly. This is like home cooking. We ate here twice and all our food choices were fresh, delicious and like we would fix at home. Yum.",1
After 3 weeks of working in the area I finally found a place off of Magazine that is not overrated. Friendly staff! Y'all know I love Phò so it's pretty damn good!,1
Our family returned for breakfast again this weekend and the food and service was again impeccable ... Highly recommend,1
"The kayaking tour at the Santa Cruz Island was great.  My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.  We didn't expect much but this tour definitely exceeded our expectation.",1
Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!,1
"After living in the STL area for way over 10 years now, I am both ashamed and remorseful to admit that I ate here for the FIRST time just a few weeks ago. I am ashamed because it's a St. Louis tradition and remorseful because I missed out on it for so..many...years! 

This place is amazing. What is not to love! It's a factory where you can get a tour (Friday-Sunday, noon-5pm on the hour), there's a shop, bar, and dining area. They also host many event with live music on the weekends. It's fun to just kind of wander and look around - don't worry, you'll get a chance because there will likely be a wait before you dine. The beer is, of course, amazing. The Hefeweizen is my personal favorite and a great start for anyone who is not a huge beer drinker (like myself). Additionally, the food is homegrown and damn good. I had the pizza (recommendation from my server) and it was really spectacular, though I'm admittedly a pizza connoisseur so I enjoy a good pizza pie more than most probably ;P My date had a bison burger which was also really good. 

More fun info: the service is great! I think they tend to hire more funky and alternative people (like tattoo parlor staff) which I support. The quality is what makes this place stand out along with the emphasis on local food and brewery. 

It is a little on the pricier side but for all the experience you get and the quality, it is worth it. I will go again and again and you probably should, too!",1
"If I could give it a zero, I would. I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn't realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.

I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it's nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!",-1
"First time here and they did a great job, very satisfied with the car wash  and the service I received. Thank you",1
"I just started going to Sushi Nara this month (they opened just a short time ago).  I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I've been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.  

I love the freshness of the food and there's a huge selection to choose from.

Everyone on the eastside, check this place out!",1
Awesome little shop.  The owner really knows his stuff and you can tell he loves his work.  They have tires and other parts you won't find anywhere else.,1
"Been here so many times before and all I can say is the food is really good. A hidden gem in Florissant, it has the best Panang curry around. Haven't been to their sister restaurant yet, but I can't seem to want to move on when I am always so satisfied with their fare here.",1
"My food only merited maybe two stars but I will give an extra star because I like the menu (and will try more of it) and their design and concept.  Sadly though, my tomato-basil soup tasted kind of like a weak marinara and my tuna melt type sandwich had a very sharp, off-putting flavor.  It was citrusy, for sure, and I love lemon in a tuna melt but perhaps this was lemon zest or something just way too overpowering?  I think next time I will focus on the dishes with cured Italian meats, mortadella and prosciutto.  And also the baked goods, those sounded pretty good, especially the Nutella bruschetta!",1
"We visited once and were very disappointed in my veggie pizza and my husband's sub sandwich.  The tomato sauce was not tasty, and they did not use enough cheese on my pizza.  The dough looked and tasted like it was prepared by a machine.  Perhaps they have improved, but we are not in any rush to try a second time.",-1
"A couple friends and I stopped by for some late night milkshakes and found ourselves at More Than Just Ice Cream. Well, we just got ice cream...not fully taking advantage of what the name implies, but maybe next time.

3 milkshakes: 1 coffee, 1 chocolate, and 1 black&white malt. 

All were pretty good. Definitely satisfied the ice cream craving. I thought my coffee milkshake could have been thicker, same goes for the chocolate. The black&white was plenty thick and was probably the best of the three. Unfortunately, I did not order that one so I settled for my not so creamy coffee.

I did sample some ice cream flavors before setting on a milkshake. I tried the pumpkin pie which was AMAZING. I don't know why I didn't just get this. Maybe a milkshake isn't the way to go here.",1
"My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday!
We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious ""compliments of the chef"" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.",1
"Man. This place is nice. The bartender was awesome. Try the burger. It's fresh with all local ingredients. The plates of food I saw come out looked amazing as well. 

The beer is cold. The drinks are mixed perfectly.  This is not a chain restaurant but a dedicated local place with good employees.",1
"I visited this restaurant 4 times during my 5 days stay. Crazy, right? Here are a list of reasons/pros:

- We were staying a nearby hotel.
- The restaurant opens 11 - 10:30 pretty much every day including new year's day so it fits into our schedule.
- If you are a party of two, chances are you get seated right away.
- $9 per dozen of oysters which is a really great deal by any standard!
- They have a seafood shop next door that sells boiled and fresh seafood to- go.
- Our server (same) is very friendly and recognized us every single time.

Now I want to talk about the reasons why I only give it 3 stars.

- We tried a bunch of stuff which are all pretty mediocre. Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper. Turtle soup has a strange taste so I definitely prefer Felix's. A portion of my boiled shrimps are always mushy somhow, maybe boiled for too long?...
- The ambient is inviting but not comfortable so we basically just finished our food and go. 
- Clean the bathroom!!

Will probably visit again if we stay in the area next time or simply just pick up some seafood quickly.",1
"Skip this train wreck if you are looking for dinner.  Our server was clueless...like we seriously thought she was lost in the restaurant.  Had to ask for setups, water refills, etc.  Ordered chicken parmesan and got eggplant parmesan instead with a fish bone in it.  The drinks were good.",1
"Meh is all I can say for TDS. The restaurant itself is just cold.... not literally, but figuratively. There was no decor, no menu boards, stainless steel prep tables as dining tables, no soda machines, staff EVERYWHERE with no identification (shirts, nametags, etc). The food is reasonably priced and most of it was quite good, but what really irked my party was the fact that they charge for extra salsa!!! We ordered a salsa trio (which included 3 samples of the various salsas, in 2oz glass prep bowls), and when my brother asked for more salsa for his tacos (mind you, we ordered one of ever taco, three burritos and guacamole), he was told he'd have to buy the trio again! Really!!??? We spent over $40 on food, drinks and apps, too. Even though the food was decent, I wouldn't return as the atmosphere is just blah and you can't get extra salsa for your damn tacos!",1
"I'm so incredibly happy with our pictures! Angela Clifton Photography have worked with us 3 times and we have been happy with every single picture that was taken! Not only are the photos fabulous, but we had such a fun experience. The price is extremely reasonable and the pictures will be a keepsake we will cherish forever!",1
Enjoyed my fish out at a sidewalk table.  A bit pricey but food was good.  Go to Side street in French quarter if u want quieter dining outside.,1
The court house is very old and the art is great. The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.,1
"I had the pleasure to meet with Ann today and not only was she extremely helpful and so positive, she went above and beyond to make my 1st experience here amazing and made it a absolute regular customer from this day forward. Thanks girlie!!",1
"This is the first time I tried this place and  I was surprisingly surprised. I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace. This may become my go to place in Carp.",1
"This place was so chill and relaxing. When I come back it'll definitely be in my list if stops. Not to mention the artist performing was fun and eclectic  (I mean really, a country version of ""Let It Go"", what's not to love?)",1
"Id you haven't been to the Smoothie King center since it was know as the New Orleans Arena, you are in for a nice surprise. The arena has had a face lift and, while the seats are the same,  everything else has been refreshed.   

Most importantly,  the food options are far more varied and appeal to many tastes.  The quality of the food is very good and significantly improved from a few years back. The drink options are much improved as well and include full service bars, spiked lemonade,  bottled and draft beer and of course, smoothies.  There is even a spot for sweets. You can get funnel cake, cotton candy, and all kinds of delicious things I was too full to take in.  

The venue finally feels a bit swanky and top notch.  We are moving on up!",1
"Don't know what it is but If my tummy's feeling icky, I can count on Chipotle's stake to fix me up. I just have to remember not to go during full on lunch time. I usually go between 2 & 4 when it's peaceful and calm. Busy or not the service is always friendly and fast!",1
"I must admit, I wasn't expecting much. This place totally blew us away. This has to be one of the best Indian restaurants in the Tampa Bay. The ambience is wonderful including white table linens. The best part was the food, OMG. The chicken 65 was to die for, and the hot sour soup was rich and flavorful. The waitress (Angel) was friendly,  attentive and very pleasant. They opened just a week ago. I'm sure this will soon be the place foodies seek out for real Indian food.",1
"Had to wait until my third trip to NOLA to actually get in the door.  First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it's a good cause...just splurge.

The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It's in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it's very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!",1
"A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!  I was a completely new customer.  I did not have an appointment because my other plans got rained out and my dealership was too busy to take me.  I needed a PA State & Emissions  inspection which I dread because they can be a total ripoff at some places when they add things on and I just wanted to get it over with.  I saw that this place had much better reviews on Yelp than many other shops in the area.  Keystone Discount Tire took my 2008 Pontiac Torrent in for inspection while I waited and had some free coffee.  I only had to get up once to look at some irregular outer front tire wear on my car when it was on the rack during inspection.  I always appreciate it when the technician lets me look at the problem.   It was nothing major.  Easily correctable with an alignment sometime in the future.  Bill was very friendly, knowledgable, and straightforward with his overall analysis of my car.  My car was fully inspected and stickered in less than an hour without my bill being jacked up with add-ons.   I recommend getting on their mailing list for their coupons!!!!!!!!!!",1
Wow! I never thought my sons phone could be repaired after he dropped it but it is and it took less than a half an hour! Very professional and excellent service! I'm thrilled!,1
Service and management terrible... After messing up all 4 of our orders the waiter got mad and started cursing... The manager offered our drinks to be free.. What a mess. The food was cold and nasty didn't even eat half of it and waited over an hour... I will never dine in any cracker barrel again after this experience...,-1
"I have been to a number of dog friendly hotels...just not in the city and did not know what to expect. Usually they are motel like.  This one was in the heart of the city.

I walked tentatively into the hotel lobby as i have a labrador/golden mix who is not easy to hide.

We got to the front desk to register and i was still feeling uneasy although my  bf had assured me it was a dog friendly hotel. Reception was so nice immediately putting us at ease. As we checked in an attendant asked if Bentley could have treats which she fullly enjoyed. The Reception person also asked if we would like a welcome kit for Bentley. Holy moly. Of course. Dog dishes, a mat, treats, etc. I was blown away.  

Plus the guests at the hotel all stopped to compliment and pet ""queen Bentley"". Our room was on the top floor. Awesome!

Even when i went to walk her the car attendants greeted her by name. We were so impressed with the service we decided to come back an extra night. 

Thank you Loews. I didnt realize a hotel could be so dog friendly especially to a big dog.",1
"Never been to this location before, never had a problem with any other location. It was almost full but there were a handful of tables open. We began to seat ourselves and was told we could sit anywhere. They came and took our drink order pretty quickly and we received them within a few minutes, the girl who delivered our drinks said they would be back to take our order.  I'd say it was almost 10 minutes before they finally came and took out order. I started to wonder who our waitress was because 2 different females took the drink order and delivered them. Finally, one of the females came and took our order, so we must have been there for 15 minutes at least before our food order was taken. 10 minutes had gone by and a lady got sat in the booth next to us. Another 10 minutes later, she got her food before we did. So she got there after us, ordered after us, but received hers before us. Our waitress refilled my husband's coffee twice the whole time and she asked if I wanted a refill on my soda, I shook my head no and she could tell we were wondering where our food was, she says your food is almost ready, the kitchen is overwhelmed right now. But there was only maybe one new customer that came in since we had been there. I told my husband if we didn't get our food in the next 5 minutes, we would just leave.  So, 40 minutes and no food, we walked to the register and asked if we could pay for our beverages and our waitress said our food was almost ready. I said that we didn't want to wait anymore and she said we didn't have to pay for our drinks and we left. No apology, nothing. Im thinking either our waitress forgot to enter our order, or, the 3 cooks in the kitchen just wasn't concerned about how fast the food was being cooked. They did not look flustered, so I honestly don't know what the issue was. Won't be returning. Waste of our time.",-1
"Excellent food; so so service. Ordered multiple dishes just to try them all ($80/3ppl/ 5dishes and a carafe) Bananas foster and shrimp and grits are amazing. Also tried crab omelette and huevos rancheros deluxe which were top tier. As for the service, we were told we would have to wait longer for seats at the bar because our third party had not arrived yet although we were ordering and paying for their food as well. Somewhere during the meal servers swiped utensils and a cup before we were done with them. Also swiped a plate with extra sauce while we wet trying to box leftovers and then wanted to charge us a dollar for the same sauce when asked for more lol. Felt rushed out, maybe because there was a wait. Will try the other location next time.",-1
"So we walked in and a 45min wait, yeah that's not happening but there was open seating in the bar, which we took. We were told 45min for the pie as it takes that long to cook, which is standard for Chicago style. We ordered the ravioli app and beers and were impressed from there. Watching the guys and gals through the window throwing the dough and seeing the process was eat-tainment. The pie came and for 4 grown men, we couldn't put down a large it was too much.  100% we will be back.",1
"Horrible dining experience. Waitress was terribly slow. Messed up drink order. Had no artichoke and spinach dip, reason was it has been a busy week yet it was only Monday. Ordered the chicken club and only half the sandwich had chicken on it. When we told the waitress she shrugged her shoulders and didnt seem to really care.  Took forever for her to return and offer another drink. Took forever for the food also. Will not be returning here.",-1
Ordered food came super fast! But when we ordered dessert that's when it took 20 mins.  When the dessert came to the table my gf asks me is this supposed to have tomatoes I say no. She is about to eat her second bite and I tell her to stop. I find a piece of paper inside the bread pudding.  I ask for the manager and he comes over I inform him of these extra items. He offers me another bread pudding.... I decline. The waitress offered to refund my money for the dessert...,-1
"It pains me to give this review because we've had a lot of good meals here in the past but our last two dinners here had identical problems.

We went here for dinner last night. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night so we expected a little bit of a wait for our meal. But the wait was compounded by service issues.

We ordered the Vietnamese Pancake for an appetizer and Pho and Vermicelli for our entrees. Our order was taken pretty promptly but it took over a half hour for our pancake to be served. A party who arrived after us got their appetizer about ten minutes before us.

It took another twenty minutes to get my vermicelli but Baby's pho was nowhere to be found nor did our server (the older gentleman) offer an explanation or apology. We waited a minute or two but when the pho still didn't come, I flagged down the other (young) server who said he would check into it. He came back apologetically alluding to some issue and promised it would come soon.

Finally, about five minutes later, our original server delivered the pho without a word nor any acknowledgement of a problem. This is the same guy who at our last dinner forgot to place part of our order and then double charged us. 

It seems we're not the only ones whose order he screwed up. As we were taking care of our bill, we heard the party behind us pointing out that something was missing from their take-out order.

The owner used to be here frequently but we haven't seen him in quite some time so I'm wondering if in his absence he's taken his eyes off the ball leading to the slippage in service.

We really want to continue supporting Oriental Pearl so I'm hoping that they  take steps to get back on track.",-1
"This is the worst Taco Bell there is, and sadly, the only one open past 10, and sometimes 9 depending on how the others feel that day. I guess it's just a Nevada thing, or a Reno thing, but the Taco Bell's here are a joke and this is the worst. Been sitting in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to be told the item I wanted isn't offered anymore, even though commercials are still playing for it. They've forgotten our food more than once, and I personally won't eat here (wife is the hopeful for it because she loves Taco Bell) because it's given us both food poisoning.

Go to Del Taco, same food poisoning, but you'll actually get your food in a timely manner, probably.",-1
"The worst service I've had at a restaurant in years. Went on a Sunday for lunch and our waitress took forever at every step in the process, and acted like she was doing us a favor at all times. Never smiled or treated us with basic human dignity. The final straw was when she finally brought our food, I was left to stare at it while it got cold for almost 10 minutes because she didn't bring any silverware. I had to ask three different waitstaff for silverware before I finally got it. And all of this for pretty mediocre, way overpriced food. Nashville has SO MANY good restaurants (particularly burger places) that there's no reason to eat here.",-1
"A perfectly acceptable example of Papa John's pizza. I ordered delivery to my hotel on a Wednesday night....the guy that took my order over the phone was especially polite and helpful... He even looked up a coupon for me that helped me save some money on my large 3 topping pizza. Delivery was fast... Beat their quoted time by 10 minutes. Only reason for missing one star is because my pizza was a little smashed to one side in the box...while it made eating it a little messy, but it was still hot and tasted good.",1
"Finally getting around to finishing this review...  This summarizes our visit on the night of Gasparilla.  

This was, without a doubt, the absolute the worst service ever. After waiting in line for 30 minutes to be seated, we sat for 30 MORE minutes w no waitress visit. Once we actually did get served and placed our order, the food never came.  When I walked up to the counter to check on the food.... the order was never put in. We were told to wait for 10 minutes   15 minutes later was told it was 5 more minutes. Once the food arrived, it was VERY good... but we had to take it home and eat it because it was past the children's bed times at that point.  Mind you, people who arrived after we were seated got their food, ate, and left before we even saw a slice of our order.  Nice.

Recently I read a story that Cappy's has pretty much barred kids from the joint, citing misbehavior.  Well, given that on my one and only visit to the place the incredibly horrid service required my children to wait in excess of an hour and fifteen minutes to GET a pizza, this won't be an issue for me (although for once in their lives they were actually behaving despite the excessive wait).  

While I am all for the supporting of local businesses (especially in the Seminole Heights area) and definitely see the appeal of a place like Cappy's (it is pretty cool inside, and had a nice vibe), my experience coupled with the anti-kids stuff I read pretty much sealed the deal for me.  I won't be going back, with or without kids.  Stephannos is right up the road, and they make a great pie without the drama.",-1
"AWFUL. I have been there more than once, and it was never great but ok. However the most recent time we went was the WORST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a restaurant. We were sat and no one ever came to our table, I had to go get them, she got us the wrong appetizer, the food was awful and cold, everything took forever even though the restaurant was empty!!! The waitress was just terrible, I had to go find her several times. We almost got up and left and I wish we had! At the end of it our check was wrong and I never complain but when I did finally talk to the manager she didn't even care and did nothing about it. She didn't apologize or offer any kind of restitution. On our way out I did see that waitress was eating at a table, that would explain why she never came to ours!",-1
"Horrible service. Our waiter never checked us. I had to flag him down to tell him my ravioli's were terrible. I had a clump of dough on my plate and all the cheese had spilled out of the few raviolis that I had on my plate. I told the waiter, he said, huh and walked away and came back with our check. I asked him about the clump of dough and he said that's how they make them. I had to explain to him that ravioli's had filling. My husbands porkchop was very dry and bland. The waiter was very arrogant. He never said he was sorry he never came back to our table after he took our order and it took forever to get him to take our order  I had to eat 4 pieces of bread to fill up. I walked out hungry. They did take it off the bill, after a awkward conversation with the waiter. I will never go back. It was pricy for the quality of food we were given. I was so disappointing.",-1
"Stopped here after our first choice had too long of a wait. Nice place; clean and bright. You order at the counter -- oddly, while the specialty pizzas were listed on the menu board, there was no description -- and then sit down to wait. We got a 14"" two topping and two regular drinks, which came about $20. Mind you, this is with paper plates (the chintsy kind, so they brought 4 for the 2 of us) and plastic silverware. The expectation also seemed to be that you bus your own table.

The pizza sauce was very bland. My husband ordered jalapenos and the guy did honor my request to go easy on them, which I appreciate. 

At noon on a Saturday, it wasn't busy at all. 

Pet peeve: as a non-soccer fan, I don't mind seeing it on TV, but to have it on both TVs with the volume way up was overkill. Because, shocker, guess what? IT WAS A TIE. :-)",-1
"I placed an order online to create my own pizza.  I get a call from them minutes after I placed my order saying they are out of 3 of the toppings that I wanted on my pizza.  When I got the pizza delivered, it was not even edible because there was way too much cheese and the dough was SO thin towards the middle it would just fall apart where we couldn't even pick the pizza up.  It was a sloppy mess and we couldn't even eat it.  Very disappointing.",-1
"Perhaps I need to come back and order something else - but, I think the food doesn't match the hype or the line.  I ordered your standard eggs, bacon, and buttermilk pancakes and I was a little underwhelmed.  Dare I say that Cracker Barrel or IHOP would have satisfied my pancake craving better.  I'm thankful that I got to the restaurant right before the crowd started to pick up (I got there around 7:45 am).  The strange thing about eating there are the guys that continuously walk around looking for when you take your last bite - so that they can take your plate.  Kinda puts the pressure on to eat quickly and get up and out.



Bottom line: Decent food (not worth waiting more than 10 minutes for), great service, and prime location.",1
"The best:  deep fried dill pickles.  I want more.  Now.  BUT, that was the highlight.  I am one of THOSE people who want my beef well done.  In as humorous a way as I could manage, I said ""burn it!  I know how the chef probably feels about that, but I will be happy, I promise you!""  It arrives...medium well at best.  Nope, I say, not done enough.  The guy who brought the food out (not our regular waitress, so he hadn't heard the ""burn the hell out of it"" speech said ""Its not that pink"".  C'mon guys.  I'm paying for it, cook the darned thing the way I want to eat it!  He took it back and the second one was pretty close, so I ate the outside of it.  It was a patty melt and there was this little patty in the middle of huge slices of bread.  That looked weird.  Skimpy on the onions too.  If I went back (unlikely) I would just go for the pickles and a beer.  And that would be fabulous.",1
"I haven't eaten here in a while because a friend of mines quit, due to rude employers. But I was just starving. I went to order an omelette with the veggies wrapped inside instead of cooked in. I was told that I could not have it that way. Once I asked why??? Both cashiers snapped at me and told me that the cook had the right to make it however he pleased and couldn't I see how busy they were. And they didn't have anytime to special make my order.... After a verbal argument between me and the staff the had to nerve to ask if I still wanted to order. This place has good food but very very poor customer service skills. I will never spend my money there ever again... The worst service I have ever received.",-1
"Place is okay. They were the only restaurant that was able to accommodate a large party on such short notice. I ordered the black spaghetti that other patrons raved about. It was pretty disgusting. I'm not sure why he had some a weird texture and almost tasted like plastic. I've tried many different types of spaghetti and this by far was the worst plate I've tried. My co-workers said their food was okay though. Maybe it was just what I ordered that sucked. If I'm ever in Nashville again, I'd give them another go. The drinks were on point as expected.",-1
"I've been here a handful of times and it's always because I don't have time to go to VN Nails near Costco where I prefer to go (they get 5 stars from me).  Kiwi Nail has always done a cheap job trying to take shortcuts wherever possible.  But today I've had it and will never go back!  After getting the typical shabby job on a fill with French tips,  I accidentally smudged two nails really badly.  They needed to be repainted and I asked her to do so... I even offered to pay extra.  The nail tech came over to look and she pressed the clumps back down and painted right back over the mess (didn't even keep the paint in the lines) then slathered so much varnish over the train wreck that it was literally dripping down my finger. After my nails were dry enough to leave,  another tech rang me up and the receipt had no place for a tip.  When I asked,  he told me I had to pay tips in cash... Well it's lucky for me I didn't have any cash.  He said I will have to tip her next time.  NEXT TIME??!!  yeah right!  There will be no next time! Save yourself the hassle and don't bother with this d@mn place!",-1
"The food is great, but I just waited 20 minutes for a carry out order.  I called in at 12:07, my credit card was swiped at 12:32 and I didn't leave until 12:53.  I needed to get back to my office and there sat my order.  Other servers kept checking it and no one brought it over.  So my food is now cold.  $30 for cold food, even great food, still sucks.  

This is the second time someone from my office has had to wait for an order we called in.  The last time this happened, the server hadn't even given the kitchen our order.  If carry out isn't a priority, don't offer it.",-1
"Horrible service. Sat there for 20 minutes before server finally came out. Claims no one told her we were there. Guess she couldn't see us. Had to get something quick because we had tickets to the playhouse theater. Got to the restaurant with more than an hour to spare. She took our order and said she would be back with our bread. She never came back. Another 30 minutes passed, so we decided to leave. Just as we were leaving our food showed up. They couldn't believe we were leaving.  Felt good to stick it to them for a 55 minute wait. Luckily the playhouse is a short distance away.",-1
Ordered for pick up and was told 45 minutes. Arrived 45 minutes after ordering and waited another 45 minutes for cold food. Never again. I'll never pay 40$ for an hour and a half wait for cold food. I'll go to the place on the next corner and get my food faster and hotter.,-1
"I will never eat here again. I ate here a couple months ago and it was average (maybe three stars) but after this last experience they have been demoted to a one star in my eyes. We ordered the chicken saltimbocca ($23) and the chicken picante ($15) each with a side of linguine w/ the garlic butter sauce and each came with a side of escarole soup and side salad. We ordered this for pickup so they then told us that we had to bring them containers to put the soup in because they didn't have any. And I dint think this was just because they ran out bc my gf remembered this happening in the past. 

So we picked it up after we took out money at the Wawa because they don't take cards. Um its 2011, everyone uses cards. Get with the times son. We finally got the food back to my place and when we opened it up we found out that they gave us marinara sauce instead of the garlic butter and I'd usually let it slide but I was really in the mood for it and I'm tired of not getting what i ordered. So I called them up and the lady that answered the phone gave me to the guy that took the order and I explained that we didn't get the right sauces and he said in a very rude tone ""well I didn't hear your wife or your girlfriend or whoever that was say that you wanted that sauce. Its an extra 2 dollars for that sauce. I can make it for you and you can come back up and it will be 4 bucks"". I was so caught off guard and didn't know what to say I just said ""no I wont be doing that"" and hung up. After I hung up all the great comebacks that I missed out on. I felt like George Castanza in the one episode where he thinks of a bunch of witty comments after the fact. Unfortunately I wont have another chance to hit him with my comebacks because I'll never go back. 

Also the food tasted like tin foil. Sounds awesome I know..",-1
"I've had mixed experiences here. I LOVE that there are Gluten Free options for the kids. I have one son that has allergies, and the other that is sensitive to gluten, so it's tough going out to eat. Yes, gluten allergies are a real thing, not some made up Hipster bulls#!t. 

After several good experiences, we had one completely terrible one. Server had to have been new... forgot our order, lost our order, gave us the wrong food, spilled our drinks, NEVER checked on us. After 45 minutes, we went to the front and asked for our original order to go. It was still wrong, and they told us another 5 minutes. Almost an hour later, we left with our food and barely made our son's school open house.

I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt with a 3-star, because maybe they just had weird shiznit going on. It happens. I'll update with more stars after more visits. I have faith in this place!",-1
"One recommendation: STAY AWAY FROM THE MARGARITAS!

For $5.00, you get a small cup of artificially flavored, watered down liquid that reminds me of the restaurant cocktail mix bottles sold at Bed Bath & Beyond.  A Mexican establishment, with a bar and expansive drink selection, should always serve decent margaritas - no exceptions.  And the service was just as awful.  Our waitress didn't fill up our water glasses once in the 3 hours we were there, and for our table of 4, she repeatedly got our drinks wrong (but because it took forever to get them, it wasn't worth asking her to correct the orders). 

For the same price, I can go to Bakersfield and drink freshly squeeze lime juice with premium, smooth tequila, and it comes in a substantially larger size.  So you can guess where I will be the next time I have a hankering for margs...",-1
Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service.,-1
"Before I moved a year ago, I never lived near a Rally's. Now I'm hard pressed not to visit more often.

The people at this location are always friendly! That's a big plus, especially with fast-food.

My favourites are the big chicken sandwich and the fries. The chicken sandwich is quite cheap for both the quantity and quality of what you're getting, and the fries... Rally's fries are just perfectly seasoned awesomeness in a cup.

BEST: Friendly, polite employees, quality food.

WORST: On one visit they accidentally got a chicken-nugget into an order of fries. It wouldn't have been a problem except they were my girlfriend's fries and she was eating while driving and she didn't realize until it was in her mouth. And she's a vegetarian. So she was nauseous and didn't eat the rest of her fries. Which was a score for me, but yeah, that did cost a star because now she doesn't want to go there as much.",1
"I've gone back and forth with giving this place 4 or 5 stars, I am settling with 4 only because of the pain in the tail service we had when we first arrived.

I was told by all my Philly friends that I had to go here for crab fries when I was town.  Friday night during the Phillies game we went to Chickie's and Pete's, we were immediately seated at a two top table.  While delivering our beers and crab fries, the server asked us if we were ready to order.  We explained that we would be there for the game and we were pacing ourselves and her response was ""the whole game, well you better be constantly ordering if you are going to take up my table.""  I totally understand her concern, and we assured her that we would in fact be ordering beers and food throughout the game.

A few moments later she walked through her section complaining and cussing about the $1.00 tip she received from her table, again, I understand her concern, but there is a time and a place.  She then cleared a table and came to take the order of the people next to us, and placed the dirty plate of shrimp peels on the table, gross.  While our beers sat empty she sat down a few tables near us and had a 10 minute conversation with her friends that were dining there.  Another table sat down and again we heard the same speech about not talking up her tables and that they had to order all night (glad it wasn't just us).  At this point, our beers had been empty for 20 minutes.  

My friend went over to the bar, found 2 empty chairs and I asked her for our check.  She knew we had planned to stay all night and asked why we were leaving, and I was happy to tell her that we were not going to take up her table.  Our check was $14.00 and I left $24.00 hoping that she would take that act of kindness and extend it to the poor patrons who had to deal with her next.

Now.... Onto the experience at the bar... TOTALLY AMAZING.  The bar staff that was working on Friday 4/19/13 made our night.  They were friendly, informative, suggested what yumminess to order on the menu!  Over all, those 4 gentlemen negated the unfortunate experience on the other side of the restaurant.  

The food by the way... the crab fries... yum'tastic!  My friend ordered the ""red"" mussels and I had the ""bleu"" mussels.  I feel like we ate all night long and never put a dent in them.  Absolutely amazing.  If I am ever back in Philly... I will 100% be visiting the bar at Chickie's and Pete's!!",1
"DO NOT GO HERE THEY ARE THE WORST  GO TO MASSAGE ENVY 
IN MT LAUREL OR CHERRY HILL AND BE TREATED RIGHT 
Hand & Stone is a money hungry thieving deceptive company. I had the worst massage at the Marlton location then as I went to pay with a Gift card that was given to me as a gift I was told by the rude receptionist that I had to pay $11.00 because my card had expired. SO I RECEIVED A TERRIBLE MASSAGE AND WAS RIPPED OFF FOR $ 11.00. I filled out a bad survey online then received a nasty email from the Manage her name is Jessika Morrow SHE WAS THE WORST I guess she feels it's ok to talk to customers like crap has horrible manager skills and should not have this position. when I said I would leave feedback as the worst place and massage I have ever had her response was I DON'T CARE DO WHAT YOU WANT... GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS The worst. I then called the Corporate Office and asked to speak to the Owners of the Franchise there names are Steve and Fred Vaccaro needless to say after leaving 3 messages for them to call me about this terrible situation they could have cared less to have called me to listen to my concerns. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO HAND & STONE AGAIN I GUESS THE $11.00 WAS WORTH LOSING A CUSTOMER KEEP IT UP AND YOU WILL BE HEADED WHERE KMART AND SEARS ARE GOING.....GREAT JOB JESSIKA WHAT A GEM...",-1
"We visited the Ihop on Canal Street after a day of traveling and were seated by a friendly waitress. In our group, there were two adults and four children, ages 14, 13, 5 and 3. The waitress brought our drinks and took our order quite efficiently. When the food arrived, one five-stack of buttermilk pancakes were missing. My daughter had to sit and watch everyone eat for some time, while the waitress made promises each trip past our table. Knowing she was starving, I finally gave her one f my three pancakes so she had something in front of her while she waited.

Finally, her order arrived and she began eating. The waitress left my bill on the table - $54. I had ordered the Colorado Omelette which was quite good but when I finished most of it and started on my pancakes, I got a nasty nasty surprise. With the second bite of my pancakes, something felt wrong in my mouth. I reached in and found a hair. I started pulling it out of my mouth and it kept coming and coming, like a fishing line!!! UGH MY GAWD. The thing took both hands and turned out to be a curly reddish hair. It was not mine nor the waitresses as it had obviously been cooked into the pancake. This made me sick to my stomach, of course.

I called the waitress over and showed her. She quickly told me the hair did not match anyone on duty (WHO CARES ABOUT THAT? THE DAMN THING WAS IN MY FOOD!) She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager and I said no, please just take this food away from the table. She did not ask me if I wanted a replacement (even though I would have said no, it would have been nice if she had offered). She came back to the table a few minutes later and picked up the $54 check, leaving another in its place. I thought maybe she had took my meal off of the bill but NO - now my total was $63.89. Listed as a service charge was $7.73 - she had included her own gratuity after the hair was found. 

IHOP used to be my ultimate favorite restaurant but now it just makes my stomach churn and brings back a memory I cannot erase. I will never, ever return to this restaurant and unless something changes in the future, I will never eat at another IHOP err... IHAIR again!!!  

And since when did IHOP start adding gratuity into their checks?????????????????",-1
"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c'est la vie. 

The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don't have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.

I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. 

The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.

My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. 

All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering.",1
So far I've been sitting here wanting to dine in for about 30 minutes and have yet to see a waitress. Had to finally get up from my table and go order a pizza and drinks from the front counter. There are two waitresses and about 5 tables of families. The waitresses are lazy and would rather stand around talking to friends than wait on a table. The girl just told the next family that came in here that it would be a better idea if they ordered to go than to dine in! LOL what a joke! This place is crap. Don't bother trying to eat here. Get delivery instead.,-1
"Ordered curried chicken, teriyaki, and some eggrolls with soup...I never got that order

This was my first and last time ordering food from here. Delivery was quick, I'll give them that, but the order was wrong. When I called in they said I can have a free meal on them for the mistake.

I said, okay ""I want that free meal now"" (they also offer free delivery for orders over 12.00$) my food came out to 14.87$, 18.87$ with tip.


They refused multiple times (like it'll make a difference if they bring it now or tomorrow, either way it was a lie to get me off the phone). I informed her that if she didn't send her delivery guy back I'll dispute the amount paid to them with my bank, and they'll lose a new customer. 

Normally if one thing in my order was wrong I wouldn't mind at all. It's because my entire order was Wong...",-1
"Just the facts: the front desk was kind and friendly. We wrote our party's shoe sizes on the appropriate slip and received our footware. A few pairs were the wrong size (3 of 8), but it was easy enough to resolve. After getting settled at our lane, we ordered a few drinks. After receiving our drinks, the waitress (named Leah E., according to our receipt) never came back to us. We waited for roughly 30 minutes for her to come to us but never did. For approximately 20 minutes after that, we waited for her to come into our vicinity and tried to flag her down, but it took a few tries before she saw us. Please know that while the lanes on either side of us also had parties, half of the lanes were unused, the bar was not full, and the tables were empty. It was a Sunday evening at about 8:30 or 9. Once the food was delivered, we never saw our server again. Please don't misconstrue my statement as hyperbole...I didn't just not see the server at our table, I didn't see her at any table. She didn't check on the two neighboring parties, but we did see her behind the bar a few times. She was not the only server on staff, as others were seen serving other lanes and, as established previously, the place was not busting at the seams. The food order was wrong, the drink order was improperly charged, we had to go to the bar for silverware. We did go to the bar for drinks due to her absence, and the bar service was pleasant but slow. When the check came and we attempted to fix a mistake on the check (we ordered a single slider burger but were charged for a plate. When we brought it to her attention, she said not to worry about it. We asked if we would be charged for just a slider (aka the thing we ordered) or if we'd be charged the plate meal (what we got). She replied that we would be charged the single slider. When the check came, we were charged the meal. She changed it without complaint. However, someone in our group ordered two wells vodkas and she charged Ketel One to the ticket both times due to a misunderstanding. She was less happy and less willing to understand or resolve this issue, resorting to having another server bring the final ticket, run our card, and bid us farewell. She did not make eye contact after his point (even after a member from our group returned to the table to retrieve a jacket). She did not apologize for mix ups, misunderstandings, or wait times, and she did not thank us for our business or wish us good night.To top it all off: while I think waitstaff have the right to whatever emotions and experiences they will on a given shift, our server was not the most cheerful person. It could be that she had a bad night (God knows we all have em). But after seeing all of the other bad reviews, I felt it might benefit the community to add to the menagerie of disenchanted customers' reviews. As an organizational psychologist, a patron, and Louisiana resident, I wish the alley would work on resolving the issues in their customer service.",-1
"oh Millers, how i wanted to like you.  You are close to my house, have ample parking, and large spacious tables.  you even have a fireplace in the back for a little ambiance. 

friends and i tried to come here 2 or 3 times for a quick/inexpensive* bite to eat and every time there was a 30-60 minute wait. we thought this must mean they are really good.  perhaps it just means that people in Springfield are willing to settle for a less than average dining experience.  *side note- this place is not inexpensive. 

hubby and i ordered apps- he got zinger boneless wings, and i got the guacamole. portion size was ENORMOUS on the guac - it could have served 8 people, seriously.  flavor was meh. apparently the wingz were good.  hard to tell what hubby enjoyed more, the wingz or the scantily dressed hostesses. 

our server was great, attentive and pleasant.  When something went wrong she did her best to fix it. That was much appreciated.   Side salad came out wilted and gross. management offered to take it off the check, would have rather had a decent salad in the first place but i digress.  Dinner was not very flavorful - at all - and portion sizes were okay. i got the quesadilla appetizer (which was plenty for an entree) but it was very sloppily put together and had no seasoning at all.  I have had food that is presented better and tastes better at fast food restaurants, where i am happy to pay $5 for a meal.  

At the end of the meal, i badly wanted dessert but didnt want to risk another poorly flavored dish.  Not to mention, all the dishes were like lunch tray plastic, and i felt that a $50-60 dinner for two was at least worth a nicer presentation. who knows, it may have even made up for the bland flavors. 

perhaps i was let down by the fact that there always seemed to be a wait and i had over hyped it in my head.  Never have i wanted to send back everything i ordered at a restaurant before this night.  i will never be back.  my husband says he will order the wings, but takeout only. no more dining in at this place.",-1
"I purchased a Groupon for a night stay here in a Jr. Suite & the room was 50% off & ran $200 with the discount.  I was already heading to TN to visit some family so my mom & I decided to use the Groupon the night before I left so we'd be close to the airport.  We had both been to the hotel in the past (prior to the flood) and thought it was so gorgeous & we couldn't wait to actually stay here & see what the room would look like.  According to their website we were in for a real treat in our room but when we arrived that wasn't the case at all.  

First off, their parking has gone up & is now $18 per night to park in a lot that doesn't shuttle you & your luggage to the main hotel, you have to walk.  If you choose to valet the cost is $24 per night which I have a huge issue with...the parking is outside in their own lot, this is not a major city like NYC where parking is limited so I feel that charging people to park & walk is a bit ridiculous, I can see charging $5/10 for valet but charging me to park my own car & shlep my own bags is a slap in the face especially considering the room rates.  How are locals supposed to be patrons to the businesses inside if they have to pay that much just to park?  

The hotel itself if gorgeous but the room was pretty boring...it was a large single room with a 4 person dining table & 2 armchairs, it was not at all what was explained on their website which indicated ""Our suites include a moderate-size living room and optional connecting bedrooms with endless possibilities for entertaining or for small corporate meetings"".  This led me to believe that we wouldn't be sleeping in the moderate sized living room & have no bedroom at all.  At no time during booking or check in was I asked how many beds I wanted & since I thought our suite had bedroom(s) I didn't ask & when we got to the room we had 1 king.  I called down to the front desk first to ask why we were put in a standard room & why it only had 1 bed & I was told ""our Jr. suite is just 1 large room & you should have specified when asked how many beds you wanted"" I replied ""I was never asked during booking or check in what I wanted"" I was then told ""well, if you want to change to 2 beds I can transfer you to the front desk & you can see if they have anything available"" and I said ""no, I don't want the hassle I guess we can just share the bed"" and was told ""OK, sorry you are disappointed"".  The guest services person didn't offer to find out the 2 bed availability for me, she didn't offer to move us to a garden view room (which is still cheaper at its standard rate than the discounted rate we paid for the suite) or offer any other solutions either & I was really disappointed with that.

Once we got over the disappointment of our room we got dressed & hit the hotel to shop, eat, cocktail & check out the murals & water shows.  First off we tried to find the water show & weren't having any luck so we proceeded to shop & asked the woman working in one of the stores where we could find them & she said ""oh, they aren't running tonight"" so that was disappointing but we moved on to exploring the murals when we were then asked by a lovely gentleman to leave because of an event that was going on behind the closed doors of the area we were in.  After a couple hours of being at the hotel we were 0 for 4 so we decided to start drinking...we hit up Fuse & each had 1 drink & our bill was $19 so we moved on to dinner at Jack Daniels which was so good & reasonable priced.  I think our total bill was under $40 & we didn't have any drinks but we did have leftovers!!  After dinner there was nothing left to do so we went back to the room for some shut eye which was great until we got the luxury of listening to our neighbors have sex.  After all of that I took an Ambien & slept really well until about  7 am when I could hear people talking in the hallway & room doors closing one after the other.  My mom said she slept for s**t because of all of the noise & it was a shame too because the bed was so comfortable.  

I'm sure that if everything we wanted to see & do would have been available to us this wouldn't have seemed like such a let down & the boring room wouldn't have been that big of a deal but considering that we weren't able to do anything that was on our list I would be hesitant to stay here again unless we had an atrium room so we could at least sit on the balcony & people watch.  

Don't get me wrong, the lush greenery & the beautiful architecture as well as the shopping & food are all amazing but as a guest I left feeling pretty let down.",-1
"I took an 8 year old and a 14 year old for the lunch special pizza.  We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don't offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn't be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.  I'm sorry to say I won't be able to take the kids here anymore.",-1
"im going to have to give this place one star for its horrible customer service:

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, ""it says it right on the sign,"" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut",-1
"My first experience did mot go well due to the heavy accents of the employees. I called ahead so my order would be ready for me to pick up and it was, it just was not what I ordered. They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.

I was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression.",1
"I came to Soy earlier this week and had a great experience. I had perused the menu prior to coming so I was pretty aware of what I would be ordering. It's a fast casual type of restaurant so you order at the register, take a number, and the food is brought to you.

I ordered the Bibimbap in the skillet-- the skillet is a must to get the crispy rice. My only complaint on the dish is that my egg was slightly overcooked-- I think this was my fault because I didn't find it and break into it right away. It was covered with gochujang sauce, which is the tastiest of Asian hot sauce condiments. Overall, the dish was very tasty, filling, and didn't seem super heavy (maybe I'm missing a key ingredient that is horrible for you, but I'm hoping not!).

While eating, a man came around and asked me if he could refill my drink or get me anything else. I really appreciated someone checking in on me after getting my food. When I was done, he also happily cleared my plate for me.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying more menu items. I hear their tacos are AMAZING.",1
"Wish I could give them 0 stars!  First - they lied about the Jeep I purchased.  The Jeep color I wanted only was available out of state so they had it shipped.  I wasn't too fond on the price but they told me ""it has a tow package"" etc.  Well, it didn't, and then when it came in, they acted like I was crazy because I complained about it not having the options we discussed. They promised me $399 a month... when I got the paperwork it was $430... they wouldn't budge on the price even though we had already agreed on the price and I was told ""just don't buy a cup of coffee every morning for the next 6 years.""   Second... I had the worst experience with their service department.  I took my vehicle in for inspection and they told me, that my not even 3 year old vehicle needed all new brakes, rotors, etc.  I was going on vacation and needed my car and to pass inspection so I paid hundred and hundred of dollars to them to have everything replaced.  While I was on vacation, my brakes started smoking.  Took it to a mechanic and needed to have the ROTORS AND BREAKS REPLACED AGAIN... We were left on vacation without a car for 3 days (TERRIBLE) and when I called, and spoke to the service manager to tell him that whatever they did was wrong and everything was smoking and needed to be replaced again just weeks after they replaced them, he said to me ""What do you want me to do?"" .  So I had to shell out ANOTHER $500+ to FIX their mistakes.  Do yourself a favor, drive to Morgantown, heck Lancater or Boyertown.",-1
"If you love waiting forever for ice cream in a cup because the employees enjoy standing around talking rather than working then this is your place! I ordered one thing, which I got, then waited several minutes for just a simple ice cream in a cup. 5 employees sat around talking to each other. I get it, working with friends is fun but when there's customers waiting for food, especially simple orders, it needs to be taken care of. Not to mention they brought the wrong thing out, and when I corrected them, I still waited several more minutes for ice cream in a cup. The order taker did apologize for the wait before I ordered but with 5 employees working I'd imagine they could've been able to take an order without waiting for the person up next to leave. I've worked in tons of restaurants before and if it was up to me I'd implement some serious re-training, especially based on similar reviews.",-1
"El Rey is my favorite Americanized Mexican restaurant in Nashville!! By that I mean the Mexican food that is covered in cheese... aka not really authentic but the stuff I grew up on :) 

What makes El Rey stand out is that their meat is seasoned and extremely flavorful. Typically when I go to one of these places, the chicken is bland and has zero taste. Not so at El Rey! I have had multiple dishes here and I have not been disappointed once. I eat here on a regular basis, and they are consistent with their food and it being good every time. I'm not a big ground beef fan, but my BF gets it most visits, and he said it's the best he's had from a Mexican restaurant. The salsa is also great, spicy and they bring plenty of it! (I hate asking for salsa over and over!) 

The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because their margaritas are weak. Go for the food not the drinks, and you will not be sorry!",1
Food was decent but service was absolutely horrible. We ordered Sushi and a dinner plate and it took forever to get any help for drinks. If you want quick and crapy Japanese food I recommend this place.,1
"The diner was extremely busy and the waitresses were being pushed to their limits.  The problem was the kitchen, obviously, when the food came it was dry and overdone, the sides came later, the desert was not cooked(rice pudding).  The waitress did offer another choice and we will see how that is later as after being there over 1 hr we brought home.  The owners or managers only seem to care if a substitute was made and who was your server but not that the kitchen staff is being overworked with this crowd and cannot be attentive to their cooking when being pushed like this.  The first manager pushed me to second manager and they really don't seem to care as long as they can push the crowd to fill the tables.  A few waitresses heard my complaints and thanked me as they said they have been trying to tell them this too.  Well, that is my last visit here as I would rather go up the street to a smaller diner (Club Diner) and get a better meal and more attentive staff.",-1

  First's, she didn't consider the time zone difference, I transferred from the PAC time zone, and the small mom & pop store opens at 10 Am PAC, means 1 PM EST. She's so upset and certainly that the phone number I gave her was absolutely was a bad number. I called myself, they have a recordings telling their hours. What they're missing is telling the hours are PAC, though I told CVS their address as well. Besides who buy medicines out of state? Except traveling?
  Second's, a young pharmacist didn't know much has to ask some body and forgot to answer my very basic question ""Does my plan covers?"". When I asked, shows his impoliteness. 

I will transfer to Rite Aide, if my new plan is covered. I've been with Rite Aide before, they're better than CVS, my opinion.",-1
"Even half priced feels overpriced when the service is so poor you cant get water when you literally flag down a woman holding a full water pitcher to return to the kitchen and then you have to add a tip on top of it. mediocre sushi from the one I got and I didn't hear any raving down the table of choices. You will smell unpleasantly deep fried coming away from this place. 

Overall, way too many better options to want eat here again.",-1
"Quite disappointed - not in the chain, but certainly in this location. This is the third time in a row we've had problems with our meal. The last caused us not to come back for over a year - and we should have stayed away.

On this Sunday evening, the restaurant was busy, but not jammed. There were five in our party, and we continually had to remind our server about things we were missing before our meals even arrived - butter, silverware sets, refills on beverages... 

I ordered a 13oz ribeye, rare, with only squash from the mixed vegetables. When it arrived 20 minutes later, the uneven piece of meat was medium rare on the thick end, and medium to well the rest of the cut - and I had a full serving of mixed vegetables with only one piece of squash. The manager took it to recook the order - and brought back a piece of meat so rare it was cold in the center and tough. I was hungry, so I chomped my way through.

Another steak was over-cooked, a third plate was missing sour cream and butter for a potato, cold shrimp on a fourth, and almost raw (crunchy) vegetables on the fifth.

The manager (Cody) apologized when he took my plate, but never checked back to see if my issue was resolved and for us to tell him about the other problems at the table. When the check arrived - full price. No offer of a dessert for the issues, nothing off the bill.

We will not be back. Jesse's is just a bit up the road, and the quality of both the food and the service are head and shoulders above this Outback.

One shout-out - Kate was great in helping to resolve issues, but she was tied up training someone else and we didn't see her again.",-1
After reading the reviews we decided to give Jesse's a try and sadly it didn't really meet our expectations.  The service was great but the food was mediocre; the steak was bland and the shrimp cocktail was nasty.  I had high hopes for this place but wouldn't recommend it to any one looking for asking for a good place to eat.,-1
"I found myself in The Big Easy for a convention back in the beginning of May. I stayed about 1.5 miles from the Convention center thinking a morning walk with a breakfast stop would be good for me. I went online and looked at reviews and picked a few spots along my route that I felt would be worthy of checking out for breakfast. As I was strolling along Magazine Street I peaked in the window of what I thought was a Pastry/Cake/Sweets stuff kind of place. ""BITTERSWEET confections"" For a moment I thought maybe they weren't open yet because it wasn't crowded with a line out the door like others I had passed.  Then I glanced over at the menu and I spotted the breakfast menu!!  I said to myself, give it a try, why wait in a line for 30 min elsewhere, you're right HERE dude. So I walked in and that is when my 3 day RELATIONSHIP started!.  Yep, it was so damn good I went back every day on my morning walk to the convention. Day one I asked to speak to the chef, a lovely lady FULL of passion about her food and family recipes. She makes a damn good Biscuit!! I wanted to apologize for not being able to finish my meal (Healthy Portions) and I didn't want anyone to think I was dissatisfied. She smiled, thanked me and said I'll see you tomorrow and tomorrow she did along with the day after. I could only finish half of my meal so on the remainder of my walk to the convention the next day I would find someone along the way who hadn't eaten yet and pass on the deliciousness of the day! It was a wonderful experience.  On my final day my local friend wanted to take me out for breakfast at one of ""THE SPOTS"", the convention was over and I wasn't on any schedule. We walked to the place she recommended (a very popular spot, with a very long line and wait). I said, I can't do this long line, let me show you a spot I found! So we took a nice morning stroll over to Bittersweet. BOOM!, another AMAZING meal, there was also a young couple that had come in for a tasting to pick out wedding cakes. I overheard them say they were on a budget with a humble look in their eyes. I can tell you from my seat they were treated like a respected customer who had deep pockets. I was thinking to myself if that cake tastes anything like the breakfasts I've been having these kids are in for a real TREAT!! Apologies for taking soooo long to sit down and post a review.  5 stars!!",1
Very disappointed in them. I made an appointment to have an alignment on my vehicle a week in advance when I made the appointment he said he would get it right in at 8:00 in the morning. At 9:30 I went to check on it. They hadn't even touched. Don't make promises you can't keep. When you know you can't keep the promise let the customer know with a phone call. They never offered a substitute to fix a problem that was not mine. He apologized but then said it wasn't their fault.  Well the truth is it is.  You are the business you should own when mistakes are made. I am the customer and that does not put faith in the situation for me.  I also explained in the morning I need my vehicle back at a certain time. To make sure and remind of the situation at hand. This is terrible service. Would not recommend them do anyone.,-1
"I order from this restaraunt all the time usually for their bone in spear ribs, singapore mei fun, chicken wings, house lo mein and order often when it wasnt that good to begin with though it was conveinent on a late night. I had ordered a house lo mein chicken wings and ribs like usual and had a taste for pineapple on the side when i receives my delivery like always i tip the driver well and before i could get settled into my meal i noticed that my pineapple was missing so i called and notified them and i wanted them to bring it before they closed for the night and they told me they couldnt and i would have to get it the next day because their driver was gone home for the next which is not my problem i called 5 mins after he delivered to my house so i dont see why they couldnt reach him its not like we don't have cell phones in this age so I felt put off and dishonoured as a valued customer since every time I order I spend about $40 every time. So the next day I call and have to re explain with my receipt in hand and order number they promised they would bring it and they never called or showed up so I waited a day then called again and the same thing happened so at this point I'm never ordering from them again such a big disappointment",-1
"I went to Vegetate twice, and I will never go again. I went once on a Tuesday and got excited about the food prospects and wanted to try it all. I had a pita with tempura fried quinoa that was good, but dry without any tzatziki. I also had the green beans which were way too oily and I couldn't finish them.  

The next day I went back in for food again and realized virtually nothing in the window had changed except there was less vegetable lasagna. This really concerned me as it was now 11:50 am and I didn't think a lot of people would have eaten it already. I then realized that probably none of this stuff was cooked very fresh and it was oily as a way to preserve it.

 I got the vietnamese tofu sandwich with whole grain. They nuked it in a microwave and I had to wait five minutes for it to cool down. The bread was really dry and hard and flavorless. The tofu had no remarkable flavor, and the carrots were seemingly doused with chili to make the flavor of the whole thing. I couldn't eat the sandwich and ended up eating the tofu out of it and going to Joe for a croissant after to be full enough to wait for dinner.

The employee there was really not wanting to help in any way shape or form. She looked at me annoyed when I asked for a cup of water.  I paid cash which she looked at me annoying because she didn't get to just swipe a card and then when I had change of 1.09 she used one hand and slowly took out nine pennies using one hand acting like she couldn't even use the other hand because she didn't want to wash it again to go back to preparing food. When I asked if I could instead have a nickel and four pennies, she just looked at me and said ""no.""  This was pretty ridiculous as the register had about 15 nickels in it and she just didn't want to be helpful.

I won't go back. There's Magic Carpet for vegetarian food at 34th and Walnut. I'll go there if I ever want something, they're cheaper, nicer and fresher. This place should close and be replaced with some place that wants to give fresher food and better customer service.",-1
"I went to this store because they carried the phone that my daughter wanted.  I had researched the price and knew what i needed.
The sales Associate, seemed professional, until he told me the price of my bill!  the numbers did not add up.
I was shocked to say the least.  He was trying to sell me a shield for my phone, for 40.00- I did not ask for this.  I only wanted the phone and a case. I told him about my employer discount at least 5 times.  He gave me a ""new"" price, which seemed to be more in the ballpark of what I was looking to spend.  I asked for my receipt, and was not provided a detailed break down of what my charges were- first time ever!
I was so angry that I had to leave the store.
I called Verizon when I got home, they were able to direct me to my detailed receipt on line.  Turns out he charged me for insurance that I was not offered nor did I want and he did not give me my accessory discount!
I am still so angry over how this sales associate tried to screw me and my daughter.  Buyer beware!!! ask for a detailed receipt.  do some homework before you go if you choose to use this store.  needless to say I will never go back there!",-1
"I love this place. 

Was in town for a convention and I stumbled in. It is a tiny place, with only Sam - an old Japanese man - working behind the counter. He seemed annoyed that I was interrupting him making sushi for other people, and clearly was a big fan of rules. 

-You have to sit and wait for him to be ready to ask for your order.
-Even though its only $1, don't order miso, it makes you look like an ignorant American
-Don't get impatient - you'll be waiting 15-30 minutes (as the hand written sign says). 
-No phone orders. He gets mad if you even ask. 

If you know what you're in for, its a great place. Two enormous rolls that taste great for $6. I went back the next day as well.",1
"Pretty bummed I didn't try out the Catbird Seat, because this place was totes underwhelming. When you enter, there is a large, awkward entrance and you have to go upstairs to be seated. It was probably only half full, but since it was strange weather, we decided to sit indoors. I'll just say again, walking up towards the hostess as she watches you approach just feels....weird. 

Our server was nice, and we joked with him about the silly flower in a very knock-over-able vase. We got two drinks--julep and one of their other ones with gin, both of which were utterly average to bad. 

The crowd was sort of stuffy. The bread was blah. The food was pretty forgettable. The tenderloin was good because it was a good cut of meat. The Amish chicken was pretty average, with a not so flavorful and slightly MSG-y twang jus. Their signature grits was underwhelming as well. 

All in all, stuffy and so overpriced. Bummed out!",-1
"First off, the service was wonderful! They were always checking on us and we didn't have to ask for our server to come. I was excited to go to this place because everyone said that the ramen was good here and it did not fail my expectations. I have tried three of the ramens on the menu and they were the best. The first taste when I drank the broth made me finish the whole bowl! I enjoyed everything about this place and wish it grows with more ramen to its menu.",1
"You would think from the size of the place it would be good for groups, but in my experience with 9 people on Saturday at 11am it was about a very hungry, tiring wait to get a seat. 

We tried to make reservations, but they do not take them. And I think we were too small to be put in the side meeting room. So hangry we stood, hoping for just the right table to leave.

The manager was nice enough to offer to fill cups of coffee for us while we waited. But I thought it was odd that they just didn't refill the pot for everyone who was waiting. 

Now for the food...They have these 1/2 and 1/2 combos. Which I love! I got a turkey Reuben and salad. I asked for lots of sauerkraut, and they charged $0.50 for it.. Which is no biggie but I'd expect a lot of kraut. Sadly there was not a lot of it.. But it was still a delicious sandwhich.  :) My friend got the sunrise chile rellenos. If I come back with a smaller party, that is what I would get.",1
"We  heard that Fresh Market was open and since we just got back from vaca we thought we would try it.  First of all, accolades to the staff they could not have been more helpful.  Especially Thomas in the meat section.  For these two things I would give them a five.  However, it does downhill from this point on:  ordered one pound of swiss cheese, after standing there waiting for about 5 minutes, and no one else was on line, the unfriendly clerk waited on us. The imported swiss cheese that we ordered was so poorly cut that in two days we had one clump of swiss cheese, rather than many slices.  I bought ricotta cheese for Easter and went to open it, and it was bad, although it was dated 3/28.  The tomatoes on the vine that I bought on Friday were bad by Sunday.  I have found their prices very high, selection, poor and at this point it is just not worth it. I also bought two pound cakes and their were not up to par.  Very dry and tasteless.. Overall a very disappointing shopping trip 
There is plenty of convenient parking and the store was immaculate, but it is not for me.  The final straw was that I asked for extra cash for Easter gifts, the clerk at the register said there was a $150 limit, the ATM terminal said $100 and the ""manager"" said $50...I thought they should get their act together.  Best to stay with Weaver's Way... or Whole Foods or Wegmann's.",-1
"Went to Winco to purchase my weeks worth of groceries, It was about 6pm on a weekday. Spent about 45 minutes to an hour picking out my items, stood in a long line for about 20 minutes, when I got to the front of the line the cashier turned off her light and said I'm closed but were opening another check stand one over. Everyone that was behind me ran to the new checkstand and I was left in the back of the line for a 2nd time. Now it took 40 minutes to check out instead of 20. When I got home my ice cream was all melted. If this happens again I will walk out and let them put the groceries away.",-1
HORRIBLE!!! DONT waste your time or money! Been getting acrylics for 15 years and they are the WORST!!! Clueless woman and RUDE AF!  They cut me And made me wait and were rude to me after I waited and had lady start my nails ( while waiting for nail tech) who I know didn't even have a certificate to do nails.,-1
"Went here today for Lunch. My husband and I were quoted a 20-25 min wait to be seated. We were seated at the 20 min mark. Like your text system for that. The wait is not what got the low stars. 

We were seated and our order taken within a few minutes of being seated. Our waitress stopped by our table around the 15 mins mark wait for food to tell us that our food was about to be out. After waiting another 15 mins our food did not come out. We kept waiting another 10 mins went by our waitress came by finally and apologized for how long it was taking... I really don't like it when the wait staff says its going to be out soon and it's not, make sure you are 100% sure before promising that. We waited another 10 mins and finally our food was out.
Now getting to the food. 
Overall the food was okay, I got the fish tacos(mahi mahi and shrimp taco, my husband got a soup in a bread bowl. The mahi mahi taco was delicious the shrimp taco was a little lacking in flavor. What I really disliked about my order was the salsa and guacamole(not sure what it was but it looked like a sad attempt at guac) The guac had a weird consistency almost like tooth paste I didn't even want to try it. The salsa was okay. My husband enjoyed his soup and bread bowl, but we both agreed it probably wouldn't be a place we would be back to anytime soon.",-1
"Placed a to go order, had to repeat it multiple times over the phone and it was still wrong when I picked it up. Unfortunately I had little time and didn't have time to have it fixed. I was not offered anything but excuses and unfortunately I do not think I will be returning because of this experience.",-1
"Came for all-you-can-eat, and ended up waiting for over half an hour to get our order in. The servers completely ignored us, while taking orders from the tables around us. And on top of that, all of the rolls contain ""extras"" not listed on the menu. One roll surprised us by having sweet mustard sauce on it, which did NOT taste very good....
On the bright side, once we actually got our orders in they didn't take all that long to make them.",-1
"We tried to stop in and wait for a table for the second night in a row. The hostess was utterly useless. She refused to tell us how many tables were in front of us, rough estimate of how long it would be (other than a while), and wouldn't tell us how long a to go order would be. There were empty tables everywhere so I didn't understand why there was such a long wait. 

Since we did eat there the night before and we were trying to go back, the food was good. Best cheesecake my fiancé ever had. My steak was cooked well and flavorful. My baked potato was cold when it came out. Bread was yummy. But the service sucks so bad, I wouldn't recommend it.",-1
I was going to order delivery but the guy on the phone convinced me there was a very long wait time of 45 minutes to an hour then asked if I was sure I wanted to order. So I'll take my business elsewhere. But I hear the food is really good.,-1
"Our 7 year old is a crafting wiz - albeit I am inept at such things.  We visited Jo-Ann on a surprisingly busy Sunday evening.  4 people working in the IMMENSE store (understaffed) but still, friendly and efficient service.  Amber (??) who was running the show, cutting fabric, re-stocking bolts and cashiering was great.

They honored all 3 of our 50% off (single item) coupons.
We got alot of needed fabric, notions, needles and supplies.

LOVE IT.",1
"A great place for breakfast - the parking situation is a little difficult with them only having a small area for cars. I don't live nearby so it's always a task to get a good space. The times I've gone early in the morning it has been a little hectic and crowded. I will say - the food is delicious. The coffee is better than most i.e. Starbucks, Duncan Donuts - it's a cut above the rest!",1
"This was my first time, but my dining companion has been before and pointed out a few changes. I had the portobello stuffed pretzel and he had the black bean burger. Both were fine. Our complaint was with the sides. The options were Ruffles or store bought pasta salad. My companion said they used to have sweet potato fries so he was really disappointed since that's why we came. I think we'll stick to stopping in for a drink and skip eating there.",-1
Expensive but great service & food. The ribeye melted in my mouth. The burger was huge & delicious w/ every bite. The bread pudding is everything it's hyped up to be. Definitely go at least once & share some meals w/ friends.,1
"Ok yeah, the service can be a little high falutin', and the wait is painful but this is THE BEST BURGER EVER.  That's all you need to know.  The BEST.",1
A very neat little hole in the wall. Very clean with extremely good food in more than reasonable portions. Will definitely be back!,1
"Ohana means family, and as soon as you enter this restaurant and meet the owner teresa you will truly feel like you are just that. The food is delicious and healthy, from the meat options to vegan, you will not be disappointed with anything on the menu.",1
"I'm not sure what happened to their Kung Pao chicken, but it is horrifying. You spend more time picking out the tiny bones than ever have the time to actually enjoy the meal. The sauce is good and the chicken is crispy - ""Yeah, that's good enough. No need to listen to any more."" Uh, no. They chop the chicken into extremely small bits (with the bones inside - so now you're getting bone shards). I've injured my mouth several times. 

In the end, it makes the experience frustrating, annoying, and extremely discouraging to try anymore of their food. Please get your shit together.",-1
"$1.00 any draft beer until 10, are you kidding me!!! (Pretty damn good selection if I do say so)",1
"It's not a bad place to go, but I think it's a bit overpriced. The views are great and probably the best part about the experience. The food is decent, but I would rather eat downstairs at Bongos on the beach and I'm pretty sure the food comes from the same kitchen. 

Not a huge selection for a vegetarian, but I'm sure they would whip up anything you would ask for. 

I suppose it would be a nice first date place. Again, just not my favorite kind of place.",-1
"Seriously I love this theater! You can go on Tuesdays for 1.50 and something like 3.50 on other days. It is the ""cheap theater"". This is where they show you movies that have been out for a while. And WOW. I cannot believe this is the cheap theater. It is so nice! The screens are big, the sound and lighting and chairs and everything is just what it should be: comfortable, clean, and nice. I have been to many cheap theaters in my life and this is by far the best. I just wish it was closer to me! The Oracle cheap theater is closer to me, but by a long shot, this one is better. If it was closer I would go to movies all the time! 

Another plus, everyone there is friendly and the parking lot is huge. If this is close to you and you like movies, you should be here!",1
"Went for lunch 11/28/09
I posted pics of all our food.
Friendly service
Creative appetizers:
-andouille stuffed fried mushrooms
-special of the day appetizer smoked pork & cream cheese cakes
Main Course:
Big portion
1/2 rack of ribs YUM!
Tasted like New Orleans BBQ if I had to call it something
Ribs came with a choice of 2 sides & hush puppies
Our sides were the collard greens & cheese corn grits
We liked it all.
I ate here with my mom for lunch & shared everything.  We were so full afterwards and even had enough to go for a second lunch the next day.
I would like to return to show my hubby this cool place.",1
"Living in woodstown, the only local grocery store is Acme, so if you're in a hurry and don't have time to drive up to Mullica Hills ShopRite, the Acme is your only choice. It's overly priced and doesn't have the best selection and employees are either rude or don't care.  Their pharmacy on the other hand is the total opposite, Don and Brooke and their staff are the most caring people ever and are always on top of everything and will do whatever they can to help anyone who comes up to them. Recently though the store made a bunch of changes. I usually stop on my way home from work late weekday afternoons. You can always bet there's no baskets by the doors and need to go hunt one down in one of the checkout lanes. Shopping carts are always in the parking lot running around crashing into cars on windy days with a mind of their own.  During the summer months the tomatoes in the produce area are a fruit fly breeding ground. They replaced their four self checkout lanes with four staffed express lanes, but they only open one lane during the weekday afternoon peak hours, making the wait four times longer than before. If there was another place to get groceries between the Delaware memorial bridge and woodstown I would surely shop there because anything else would be better than this acme, but there isn't any other choice.",-1
Janine was awesome! She was very helpful and made the buying experience fun and simple.  There was no pressure and I was able to get financing  with reasonable payments. She gave me an incredible deal with all kinds of discounts and was able to explain all sorts of options and benefits available with different products. The only problem was there were too many comfy options. I can't wait to get sheets on my new bed being delivered tomorrow :),1
Cocktails were nice however the bartender Paul was perhaps the least friendly person I've met. Certainly wasn't a bartender that wants to keep patrons drinking for an extended period.,-1
"I love this place!! They have really creative and affordable vegan/ vegetarian options, including vegan pastries. And their coffee so amazing.",1
"This place has great food and really good happy hour specials! We went here twice in one day we liked it so much. We went in for happy hour and got the two for one pizza deals and they were amazing and our waitress was so nice! The only negative thing I would say is when we went back to for drinks and a quick bit later that nice with some friends we sat at the bar. The one bartender, I think she was the bar manager because the other bartenders were asking her questions, was a real bitch to us and told us her bar staff was not people friendly!?! What is that! The other bartender who was mostly helping us was nice and seemed ""people friendly"". It defiantly left a bad taste in my mouth after such a good experience there. A real bummer! Overall good food, nice waitresses, shitty bar manager!",1
"When I first  heard a family member suggest going to this restaurant and describe it as a breakfast and a Mexican restaurant in one I was certain that it would be awful. I couldn't have been more wrong. The menu was huge and full of tons of options. Being a vegetarian I am always worried when going to a new restaurant but here you do not have to worry. They have vegetarian options that aren't normal available in authentic Mexican restaurant.  The portion size vs the price was reasonable. My aunt and I were able to take home left overs for a $8 meal, which is always a plus. 


The service was fantastic even though there was only one cook and one waiter. She was very friendly and took her time when we asked questions about the menu. We also came there with a 1.5 year old and asked for specialty item (cup of fruit) and they were more than happy to make it for us without the usual  'sorry we don't offer that and I could probably get the cook to make that for you but I don't really care enough' look.",1
"You won't find anyone who loves The Preservation Hall All Stars more than me. I've seen them in several different cities. They fill my soul with happiness. I was beyond excited to finally see them at their home in nola, and the music was great as always 

But...

The set was soooo short it left me wanting more and feeling a little cheated. Happened to check my watch when we came in and the show lasted a mere 42 minutes and with in that time the musicians were introduced three times and an intern pushed the bands cd. Which means total time of music must have been like 30 minutes. I can only remember 3 songs they played. It was the late show, so maybe they just wanted to go home? Based on what other yelpers said we bought reserved tickets, and although I never imagined i'd be saying this-there must have been at least a hundred different ways to get more bang for my music buck in Nola that night. 

Like The next night when we saw the Treme brass band (Little Joe, who plays drums for preservation hall played with them). they  were so generous with their time, their spirit, and their similarly incredible music. and the club we saw them (mother in law lounge) didn't have a cover, served free spicy to die for turkey necks and had some awesome murals. Wish I could get our $90 preservation hall ticket money back and dump it all in Treme's less famous but more  deserving (on this weekend at least) bucket instead.",1
"Layover in Philly means cheesesteak on my belly! This is delicious and the only thing preventing me from 5 stars is the fact that I don't know how to order! Sounds silly but the menu is as basic and clear, but I didn't know that if I wanted more than just meat, then I don't order the cheesesteak. I have to order the hoagie or the Italian, etc. cheese fries are awesome. Oh - and another thing preventing a 5 star (again, silly) but they ask me for my name. They have gotten it wrong every time and then to top it off, they don't call your name, they call your number. Very minor but then I'm thinking to myself ""why'd you take my name?!""",1
"We have always had a warm spot in our hearts for this place. We have been here numerous times over the last three decades. Let's just say we used to eat for less than $15 for two and leave it at that. We were downtown for the Nashville Hot Wings Festival which was sort of a disappointment. We purchased the all you can eat wristband - so the fact that we were at the Old Spaghetti Factory should give you a clue as to how well the festival went. Drinks at the bar - 30 minute wait - expected - so no big deal. I have always ordered the potpourri - a selection of four of their mainstay sauces. Getting excited as is see dishes come to tables nearby with the manager's special (two sauce selections) with huge portions of each. I get mine and it's like...wait...what!? Miniscule servings of each of the four sauces. I feel cheated. Don't get me wrong - the flavor was there, but in comparison to neighboring tables as well as others at our table - I got screwed.

If you let them know - you can embarrass a party member that has a birthday, because they ask whoever is in earshot to sing happy birthday to them. Amber was the center of attention in our area. What's funny is that I ran into her on the street a little later and walked up to her and said, ""Amber! How are you? It's been awhile"" She gets this deer in the headlights look trying to remember where she knew me from. ""I'm just messing with you - we were just inside and sang happy birthday to you.""

The inside layout has changed a little since our last visit. What was once the foyer has been transformed into a private dining area for a large group. What was once a waiting area has been made into additional dining space. We sort of miss the Victorian couches and such. The hostess station is now in the area that used to be basically open to the sidewalk. Over the years we have sat in different sections of the restaurant including the trolley car. Think we enjoyed the section facing the river most of all. This trip we were right in the main traffic flow of people coming and going so atmosphere suffered. Also one of the waiters close by must have previously worked for Dick's Last Resort and was probably fired for being too obnoxious - loud - too loud for this place. 

We plan on going back, but intend to be specific as to where we sit.",-1
"I would give Dr Ilyas five stars for friendliness, professionalism, and thoroughness. Her front desk personnel is as awful, as she is good. The first problem occurred when I called to make an appointment on 5/11/17. I was told that I could get in on a cancellation in two days, at 10:40 a.m. I immediately put the time in my calendar. Then, I was told that if I preferred, a 9:40 had also opened up. I said that 10:40 worked much better for me. That afternoon, I received a confirmation call, stating that I was scheduled for 9:40. I called back immediately, but of course, my appointment time was already given to someone else. Not happy, but at least I was getting in quickly. I was seen there on 5/13/17 as a new patient. You would think that the first people who greet you, would put their best foot forward. What I received was a, ""sign in here, and fill out these pages"". It was like being greeted by disinterested teenagers. It went downhill from there. I was called back to the desk and told that my insurance card didn't match Aetna's information for me. I said that I had been using the same I.D. number for at least 7 years, and have had all of my claims go through with the info on the card. She was practically accusing me of using someone else's insurance, and that I would be responsible for the bill when it didn't get paid. Now, there is a designated phone number for employees of my husband's company. It never takes more than 1 minute to connect to someone. Instead of wasting time arguing with me, she could have taken the initiative to call the number on the card. Somehow, she finally found my information, but still insisted that the number on my card was incorrect. Nothing else was said, she just handed me the card, while looking as annoyed as possible. 
I should add that I am a healthcare professional, and I know the importance of having a good front desk staff. Maybe the doctors never hear what goes on at that office, but hopefully, they will pay attention to reviews. If you want a good dermatologist, I recommend Dr Ilyas. Just be prepared for the condescending young women at the desk.",1
"The beignets were so bad that we didn't even eat them. They tasted like fried shrimp and were tough as well. The pralines were gritty, but tasty. Also, the computer/register was down so no drinks available from the bar. We offered to pay cash, but this was beyond their capacity and the request was met with silence. The courtyard was lovely though and the staff courteous. But it was such a disappointment on our first stop of our first day to New Orleans.",-1
"I promised Keswick I would do a Yelp last week (sorry guys) and here it is! I don't really review a lot of things at all, but this is worth it. I had gotten a groupon for a basic tune up as a a gift and took my bike in, asking them to pay special attention to my super wobbly hub. I believe it was Brian who I spoke with and warned me that they might need to replace the wheel, promising he would call and update me. I left a little wary since usually when a bike shop tells me something like that it means they're trying to get a little something extra outta ya. But the next morning I got a call from Keswick telling me all they had to do was clean it up a little and that my bike was already done! They were also more than willing to let me keep it there for a few days since my work schedule overlapped their hours. Once I picked it up I was pleased to find that it actually rode better than when it was brand new, and I didn't end up paying more than what was already covered by the groupon. Keswick does a fast, thorough job while trying to keep it as cheap as possible for the customer, and keeping terrifically upbeat and friendly attitudes. One of the best bike shops in Philly.",1
"I frequent the Rittenhouse Square area often as an old friend runs a bar down the street, and have passed Porcini's many times. Having had a date last Saturday, I thought it would have been a good opportunity to try it out. 
The layout of the restaurant left some to be desired, as the host stand is at the back, and the place is very small save for the upstairs, but they were able to sit us almost immediately in the upstairs dining room which was small, yet charming, and slightly more roomy. A gentleman who I am guessing was the co-owner was very friendly and ensured our 8:00 reservation was filled and the wine poured. The service wasn't slow, though awkward. It seemed that our server was there when we didn't need her, yet not there when we did, though she had a very friendly demeanor and was not rushing us in the least.
The food was delicious, though a few things stood out to me as peculiar, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. This was a legit Italian restaurant, yet they had ravioli as an antipasto. Anybody who knows Italian knows this means ""before"" the pasta, not the pasta itself. Secondly, the bread, which was very good, came with butter, and not Olive Oil. Again, this was an Italian restaurant, not an Applebee's. 
For our appetizer we ordered eggplant, which was okay. Was sliced a bit too thin, though this may have been personal preference, but in doing so was masked by the (delicious) red gravy and (addictive) mozzarella, which was very fresh, so while I may not have been tasting the eggplant, I was tasting some very delicious flavors. 
Our main courses came in due time afterwards, enough to let our eggplant digest, but not enough time to make us forget. I ordered the special, linguine in a light vodka cream sauce with salmon and capers, my date ordered the canneloni. Both were inspired. Not the gigantic portions known to most frequent Italian restaurant goers in Philadelphia, but just enough. The flavors were subtle, yet plentiful. 
We did skip dessert in favor of coffee. I ordered a double espresso, my date a cappucino (I know, but she was cute, so it's okay). The waittress came out with a regular and double cappucino. Wasn't the end of the world, so I just enjoyed it, and it was good, but just speak up if you want an espresso. 
Overall I recommend this place, mainly for the main courses, but am willing to go back and give it another shot and give Porcini's their 5th star. I hope I can!",1
"We order here all the time and the pizza is delicious
Well tonight the failed me we got and xl pepperoni and xl cheese steak no mushrooms... and 2 orders of cheese bread. We had it delivered we were told 45 min to an hr np

It took an hr and 25min the entire bottom of the pizza and bread sticks were over done 
You could play the drums on it with a fork it was so hard! 
Also cheese steak pizza had MUSHROOMS

GONNA be awhile before I order from you again
Very disappointed",-1
I paid well over what I was wanting to and what they told me. and they had me bring my car in 3 times to get the problem fixed. then guess what? I got my car back and it's still doing the EXACT same thing!! no problem fixed and paid for extra shit that didn't make my car better. if anything my car is worse now.,-1
"Gaylord Opryland: A Country Christmas Show with Larry Gatlin & The Gatlin Brothers! The good news of the review- the vocals of the Gatlins were delicious! Their harmonies were scrumptious leaving the audience wanting more! They sang, had audience banter, and entertained for about an hour! It was delightful! It was wonderful to hear all the brothers take the lead on various songs! The bad news was the meal prior! The mushroom soup was good, the rest was downhill! The small crab cake -most at the table didn't eat. The chicken breast was okay as were the mashed potatoes! Oddly the rolls they served with the meal were sweet with honey on them. Not a fan! The worst part was the service! They were in such a hurry they were literally taking plates before folks were through! Final thoughts-the show is worth it  to hear the brothers perform, cut the meal and cut the price and the result will be happier customers!",1
"Cute setting in Lafayette Square. Homemade Bread brought complimentary as you wait for your meal!! It was delicious....warm and soft! We had the toasted ravioli for an appetizer that was very good (pretty standard). It had a good marinara sauce for dipping. I got the whole wheat penne with a house-made meatball. It was very good. meatball tasted more like sausage than beef (I prefer beef), but still good. My husband got the canneloni, which he also really enjoyed. They offer 1/2 portions on the menu, which I got, and still wasn't able to finish my pasta. I can't wait to go back---really the bread set the stage for the whole dinner! Our waitress, Erin, was also very friendly and knowledgeable. Our glasses never went empty.",1
"My iPhone 6 screen cracked and the LCD was damaged.  I took my disabled phone in on a Sunday morning to have it repaired and I was told to come back in an hour.  I arrived a little sooner and my device was ready to pick up!  The replacement screen is beautiful and the staff was very helpful!  Only downside is that the touch ID no longer works. The manager DID offered a full refund and damaged screen to allow me to exchange my device with apple, but I declined.  I would definitely recommend this business to family and friends!",1
"I wish I read these reviews before we hired Mayflower because we had a very awful experience with the company.  I do not normally write reviews that hurt companies but this experience warrants one.

My mother and father moved from St. Louis up to Chicago and my parents are older and therefore needed the help of movers.  I could not help them move because I was in middle of moving myself.  I wish I had moved at a different time because my parents could not have been in worse hands.

The caliber of employees/movers they sent to help my mom were horrible.  I will just list some key moments during the move.


-Telling my mother ""Don't you have a husband"" whenever she asked them to move something to another spot.... It was agreed upon and paid for that they would do this extra work.  My parents are older!  They are not able to move these things anymore.

-Lewd subject matters for conversation were audibly projected through the neighborhood and in front my parents.

-Argumentative when asked to move certain things to the basement.  Again, this was agreed upon to be done when Mayflower was hired.

-After getting upset about moving things to the basement, the movers proceeded to intentionally drop and slam items around the house.  Many items are now permanently damaged.


We called and complained about the movers behavior and the customer service representative told us that the mover who argued and slammed items would not be paid.  This does not really fix any problems.


I will make sure to tell people to hire anyone but Mayflower.  Thanks for making a emotional and difficult time just even more awful.",-1
"I'm from New York City so I'm used to omelets and oatmeal for breakfast and that's not an easy thing to find in New Orleans. I can't even fathom eating fish for breakfast. I found Cafe Fleur de Lis and saw that it had a normal menu so I figured I'd try it out.

I called to find out if the oatmeal was made with milk or water and the person who answered the phone had no idea and was completely thrown for a loop. When I got there I asked if I could get the farmers omelet with egg whites and my waitress had no idea (it turns out you can). My omelet wasn't' bad, but wasn't amazing.

The person I was dining with ordered the pancakes and you have a choice of a few things that you can get with them, so he chose bananas. Again, the server had no idea what he was talking about when he ordered the pancakes with bananas. Then when they came to the table she held them up and examined the plate because she thought that they had made them and forgotten the bananas (they didn't). Also, the pancakes were alright, not great.

I wouldn't go back here. If you're in the area go to the Camellia Grill down the street. It's so much better.",-1
"Awesome brunch. About $35 for unlimited mimosas and Buffett. Buffett is on point with a full seafood bar (ahi tuna, crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, smoked salmon and more). Limited tapas style menu to order even more goodies from. I recommend you order the bananas foster over the Belgian waffles off the tapas menu: phenomenal!  And if the food and drinks don't sell you, the view and service should. Dining room has windows lining the back wall so you have a stellar view of the bay while you're dining. Our server, Jade was superb. I don't think my mimosa glass was ever empty!",1
"Lovely people, great food (received rave reviews from guests), excellent service and good planning help.  Being my first time having an event at my home, I was particularly interested in everything going smoothly.  The waitstaff explained what hors d'oeuvres were being passed and were very friendly.  I couldn't have asked for better!  The manager did a great job too.  Unfortunately, the bartender was not familiar with Manhattans or Old Fashioneds, which I specifically wanted.  Every time anyone asked for one she had to refer to a recipe or ask how they were made.  I had requested a specific bartender I had met at another party.  She was guaranteed to be my bartender but she was replaced by another at the last minute without anyone notifying me.  She was available but was pulled off at the last minute for another party.  I was very peeved by this and called the party planner.  They apologized and tried to make it right.  For a cost of $2,200 they reimbursed me $80.  Not exactly wanting my business I guess.",1
"Oh! First off, it smells delicious!

Secondly, it tastes delicious!!

We didn't know that our order of chicken came with a donut so we had ordered donuts, too, which we ended up not being disappointed about. 

They probably didn't tell us that they came with donuts because they just thought we wanted more...? Who knows. 

I ordered sweet garlic wings, the hubs ordered the combo of buttermilk ranch, and we shared in order to try different flavors. They were both scrumptious but I preferred my sweet garlic. And the donut that came with it was so juicy which sounds weird but then later someone outside of the restaurant had told us it was a honey donut which made sense. 

We also ordered the guava donut forgot what it was called though, and that too despite sounding weird was really yummy. 

Anyway, gave it 4 stars for now cos it was my first time and it was good. It'll have to wait for my return in an estimated year or so to get bumped up to a 5.",1
"The easiest car buying experience ever! I worked out the details of the purchase with salesman Larry LaRose on the phone prior to arriving at the dealership. I was nervous that once I went in person, the terms would all of a sudden change but Larry stuck to his word. He made sure I paid no more than what we discussed before and I didn't feel like I was being pressured to ""buy up"" at all. The finance dept was equally impressive. Overall, I highly recommend this dealership!",1
"They just recently opened and things were a little rough.

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

---

they say they are open for breakfast on the weekends.  OK, does 10 a.m. really mean breakfast?  Their IBJ article says they are going after an older crowd - to be honest an older crowd is already hours into their day at 10 a.m.   Our breakfast group meets at 8:30 because most of us are small business owners and have things to get done.",-1
"I have ordered from Mayfield twice and they have exceeded expectations!!! They were able to make a beautiful last minute

"The happiest place on Earth is in Florida, but its not Disney. Al's Finger Licking Good Bar-B-Que is the happiest place on earth. Its also the best restaurant I've ever been to (and I've been to restaurants that have Michelin stars). In fact, where is Al's Michelin star? Its far and away the most pleasant eating experience ever.
Once the food is served, I do not speak until the plate is clean. Not even if somebody was asking me a question. Not even if I was on a first date. And yes, this is the perfect place to bring a date. Why? Because if she doesn't like it, she's not the kind of person you should be with.
It may sound like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. I recently moved from Tampa to Tallahassee and the thing I miss most is Al's. I miss Al's more than I miss my friends and family because I still talk to them on the phone. But when it comes to Al's... there is no substitute.",1
"Ordered the small plate tortellini. It wasn't cooked and had a long brown hair mixed into the marinara sauce. I went back to return the food and was the gentleman behind the countered became argumentative and defensive.  He then begrudgingly gave me a refund and offered no other solution.  Too add to the already terrible experience, he sarcastically wished a 'nice day'.",-1
"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights for the memorial day weekend. I had one of the worst experience in this hotel. When we checked in I saw bed mattresses and pillows lying outside our room. When we entered the room, the air conditioner was not working. So I went down and told the person on the reception about it and she told me that a engineer will come soon to fix it.

After 20 min no one came. I had checked in with my family and it was a very hot day (max temperature: 94 degree Fahrenheit). This time I called the front desk and the phone was busy. I tried it few more time and I got the same result.

I thought let me get few more stuff from my car and then call them again. So when I was passing through the front desk on my way to garage I thought of talking to the receptionist. I found no one there. I came out of the hotel and I saw the receptionist smoking and chatting on her mobile!!

Eventually the engineer came and told us that there was a leakage in some duct. So we were moved to another room where the air conditioner was working.

Next, the ice vending machine was not working on our floor. I tried it one floor below and again it was dysfunctional there. So I had to go to the second floor to get some ice.

When we came back to our room next night (after spending the day in an amusement park) we found that the room was not cleaned. The bed sheets were in the same condition when we left in the morning. The trash was not emptied. The shampoo and conditioner were not replaced.

Please don't waste your money here. I will never recommend this hotel to anyone.",-1
"My family decided to take my mom out to dinner for her birthday and we wanted to try out a new place. Having heard a lot of good things about Limoncello we thought we'd give it a shot. I'm so glad we did, because this place rocks!
I haven't eaten at an Italian restaurant this good in a long time. The food was outstanding. My family is big eaters, and we did WORK! Let's start with the appetizers. I had the Calamari Fritti, which was amazing. I am a big fan of dipping sauces and loved that it came with three! I tried some of the others which were the Ariancini, clams, and mussels. All of which were equally good, especially the mussels. Next we split up a chicken ala vodka pizza. It was crisp and tasty. I got a chicken tortellini soup next. It was great and I loved that the tortellini was al dente, and not the mush commonly found in soup. Finally I got my entree, the Pescatore, which considered of a mix of seafood over linguine. I chose the white wine sauce, and it was delicious. Oh, and how could I forget, the complimentary bruschetta and limoncello was the perfect beginning and end to our meal.
I can't write this review and not mention how phenomenal the service was. We had an 8:15 reservation and were greeted by the hostess and told our table would be a few minutes. She was very kind. While we were waiting the manager came up to us, offered us drinks, and told us the next available table was ours. It was nice knowing that they cared we were waiting. After a few minutes we were seated. Our waiter was GREAT. He was very professional, told us about the specials, didn't need to write anything down, and kept our drinks full the whole meal. What more could you ask for in a waiter?
Bottom Iine here folks, if you want great italian cuisine and great service, then check out Limoncello!",1
"Went on Saturday Aug 23, 2014. 

They are a little higher price than the other.   First tray wasn't wiped down thoroughly, second was slightly damp. 

Second.   They didn't have shredded  lettuce for tacos.    Husband prefers that to eat with salad.

Third the waitress was working quite a few tables, where there was another waitress who was waiting very few tables and was barely doing that.

Now recall this was a Saturday night, so it was quite busy.     

We even asked if our waitress if they were over worked and she stated just me.

The lady who was waiting on us was so overwhelmed that she ended up quitting.

My husband mentioned that the one lady wasn't doing anything and the other was over worked, she basically said that the just started at 5 pm.   

Granted people might have less tables if they worked longer, however the difference in amount of tables were greatly different and she basically was dismissive of my husband.     Since she walked off.

Oh and the person who was supposed to take over her tables never got us anything else to drink.

So I had to drink from my husband's glass.

We will never go back to this location.  

Been to plenty across the nation, some are good and some aren't, and this was the worse as for customer service.",-1
"After spending almost the entire day on an airplane, I was in dire need of some burger action. Thankfully, B was on board so we headed to Bailey's. Brian and have been here twice together but many other times separately. My usual order is the Smoke Bomb with a side of small chili cheese fries (I'll get to these soon enough). He doesn't have a usual, just whatever he's in the mood for. This time around, I ordered a medium rare Love on the Rocks+chili cheese fries and B chose the medium rare Mediterranean (sans red curry chevre)+regular fries. 

Burgers: The Love on the Rocks is a combo of cocoa dusted beef patty, whiskey apple slaw, cherry jalapeno jam and spicy walnuts. Although I enjoyed the burger, it did not quite hit the spot as well as the Smoke Bomb typically does. The Mediterranean (lamb patty, cucumber relish, roasted red pepper, roasted tomato, red curry chevre) was so-so and was kind of bland. Another thing that I've noticed that happens quite frequently here and in other Saint Louis joints is when I ask for medium rare, there is hardly any rare. Oddly, my burger was more on the well done side and Brian's was actually medium rare. Burger-wise, we don't really feel like the burger lives up to its price and haven't been too impressed by any of the burgers we've tried.

Fries: B's not a huge fan of the fries. He felt they were a bit soggy but appreciates the variety in sauces. I, on the other hand, think that the chili cheese fries are probably one of the best things I have tried on their menu. The cheese, chili, chives, and fries combination work their magic every time for me. 

Ice cream:
After finishing up our meal B was wondering if he felt like having ice cream. I told him yes because A that's how this works and B ice cream is always a good idea. And I wasn't wrong. We chose a scoop of the Pistachio and of the Coconut Crunch. This had to be the best part of the meal for the both of us. The Coconut Crunch has pieces of dark chocolate in it and the Pistachio is absolutely delicious. This ice cream experience was just magnificent. 

Overall, we feel like Bailey's does a good job in providing a lot of options but does not always live up to the price it charges. However, chili cheese fries and the ice cream are the clear winners for us.

B rating: 3.5",1
"I don't eat a lot of meat but when I have a dinner party and need something or want to try a new recipe I go here.  Last night I wanted to get a bone for my dog's birthday. I left work early in hopes of making it in time. I live around the corner but work in West Philly. I arrived and they were closed, all dark and closed up. So I decided to call and see if someone answered, perhaps in the back cleaning up. So someone did answer and the gentleman said ""you just need a bone"" and I said ""yes"" he said, I'll be right there. He let me in and I got my birthday bone. I thought that was really nice!  The men that sell are super nice, always pleasant. My only complaint would be that you never know who is in line but that seems to be the south Philly way.",1
Not the experience we had hoped for. We were on a family vacation from Arkansas as this is one of the closest locations to us. The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants. You would think they would have better customer service and have all menu items prepped for the weekend!,-1
"Went to Luke during a bachelor party weekend which, on this night was 12 guys.
We made a reservation, but unfortunately they were not ready for us.  

But they had a bar area and we sat there and had some drinks, clams and oysters.
The service was very good as well.  

Once we were seated everyone ordered and seemed to enjoy their food.  But what I can say is, that we were mostly drunk already and just wanted to eat.

This place was had lots of New Orleans type dishes.  I went with a steak, not really sure why, but maybe because I was so hungry, I just wanted to be full.

Other than that, I can't say anything really stuck out, but the service was good, my food was good and the staff was good.",1
"The food for most part has been consistently good.  The service however has been all over the board. Sometimes they are very good, other times they are the worst. It's a crap shoot with them.  Also, NEVER pay by credit card when placing an online carryout order here. Since they don't verify orders/info when people come to pick up carryout orders, there's good chance a crook will have come in and snagged your already paid for order.",-1
"Shepards has been notorious for years for their beach club, The Wave, as well as their Tiki Bar on the holidays. Hey, guess what? It's also a hotel too!

Pretty standard as far as hotel beach resorts go -clean rooms, fairly large (2 queen beds and a couch/sitting area). A restaurant downstairs that serves lunch and dinner buffets (but it wasn't that good, didn't even soak up my alcohol!) and of course the shop where you can buy way overpriced flip-flops if you forgot yours.

Now for the Tiki Bar: large, actually two bars plus a stage area. Overlooks the bay and boats can anchor up here and enjoy the small beach front or walk up and have a tiki-drink. I can't say anything special about the drinks- they weren't specially strong and even for the holiday there was no ""special"" drink (like how about a ""memorial mai tai""?) 
Although there were a good many people there you could still walk around, dance if the notion grabbed you and *bonus* they had misters so it didn't feel too hot (not good for my lobster-lookin' body right now though!).

I have no idea about the nightclub as I have never been but I have heard many a stories about this place.

Great party hotel, where you can catch some rays, some drinks and some late nights dancing.",1
"Yelp doesn't allow to leave 0 star review, so that is why you see one star. Me and my wife are moving from NY to South California, and we contacted 5 different moving companies. I sent my initial email to United Van Lines on 05/02/2018, and soon I got email back with Virtual Survey confirmation for 05/10. The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we ""screened"" through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don't need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don't see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional.",-1
"Wish I could give 0 stars! We went with a lot of clothes in hand and while they were going through them, we looked around the store. They lied to us and said they wouldn't take clothes that were more than 18 months out of style/trend! Jeans and T-Shirts are NEVER out of trend.  They didn't buy anything from us and they were sending everyone who came in to sell their clothes away without buying anything from anyone because they were too lazy and didn't want to do work.",-1

"Hey, you know what. I'm going to have to give these guys a decent review. I know people have slammed them, but hey, but in some cases I think you need to have your expectations in line with reality. 

So, I was pleasantly surprised & I thought it was pretty dang good. Wanna know why? Keep reading:

The veggie egg rolls were nice and crisp and had a pleasant flavor. The crab rangoons were actually of a decent quality--not those cheapo 'crap' rangoons that have little substance coupled with an unpleasant sweetness. Believe me I know the difference, so when I took the first bite into that cream cheesy goodness, I thought at least it's got *that* going for it. They went from rangoon to ran-'gone'! HAHAHAHA!!

The veggie Lo Mein was really nicely done with the smoky wok flavor. Now, in my experience, this is the true test of a decent Chinese place compared with bad one. Another review said something to the effect of ""it's hard to screw up Chinese food."" Not true!!! The worst plate of Lo Mein I've ever had was in Bentonville Arkansas. Why? Because it had no smoky wok flavor!!! You need the essence of that smoky Chinese grill surface. This is the reason I don't like PF Chang's. The food  at PF Changs's has no 'soul'. This Lo Mein was good and contained the essence that I love in good Lo Mein. Nice balanced flavor and the essence of the grill! 

The veggie fried rice was decent as well--no complaints. 

It's maybe a tad more expensive that some other Chinese places nearby that deliver, but given the vast improvement in quality, I'm not going to complain at all.

So is it as good as it gets?....Well... that's relative. But given that they provided a decent quality crab rangoon, a smoky wok flavor and they deliver in a manner that it was pretty timely and decently warm upon arrival, hey, I feel like sticking up for these guys!

I will happily order again.",1
I can only say that I completely agree with everything Dan N said on his review. Basically same experience. One person in our party ordered the Roll and it can only half baked with raw dough in the middle. Waitress got an attitude with us like it was our fault. They put the roll back in the oven for a few and brought it back still uncooked. Now we are sitting here still waiting for the replacement to come and all are finished with our meals. Ugh!!,-1
"Was here over Labor Day weekend, so yes the place was packed and there was a long line! We decided to order at the window and eat on the tables located on the pier. The long was line and we did wait a long time but once we ordered the food didn't take as long as I thought. It's pricey but it's seafood and worth it!! We ordered the lobster sandwich, calm chowder, and a side of onion rings. The lobster sandwich was AMAZING!! They look small but trust me it's loaded with a ton of lobster and was super filling. The clam chowder was good, as well as the onion rings. But the lobster sandwich is a must try!!!!",1
"I usually wait a few months before giving a new restaurant a try because every new kitchen needs to ""shake out"" serving and cooking problems. I made an exception with Something Grilled because I am a huge barbecue fan. This used to be a takeout only place in Honey Brook, and they have moved to Exton and opened their first restaurant. Getting to know a new market, and adapting to new staffing issues takes time. Having eaten takeout from here once, and eaten in once, here are my first impressions...  

My takeout order was a rack of ribs with three sides and cornbread. The ribs were dry-rubbed and finished with a sweet Memphis style sauce with no ""heat."" The ribs are baby-back, not regular pork ribs, and for baby-backs were quite meaty and done nicely. They did NOT ""fall off the bone,"" and had just the right amount of ""tooth"" necessary for good ribs. The sides were summer slaw, which was spectacular; competent potato salad, which was potato,milk, butter, and pickle relish style; and mac and cheese, which was suitably creamy and a little stringy with mild white cheddar. The mac and cheese would have benefited from sharp cheddar and a little cayenne; it was pretty bland.

When I stopped by for lunch, I ordered the Carolina pulled pork barbecue sandwich with a side of ranch fries well done. Service was swift, but it was well after the lunch rush. I ordered ice tea, which was brewed (a good sign), and was given a basket of corn muffins and honey-cinnamon butter. The fries were well done as requested, and the sandwich was excellent -- stacked high with pulled pork with a light vinegar sauce and topped with summer slaw. The twist is that they bake a slice of mild white cheddar onto the bottom of the top bun. You barely notice it, but it does help hold the slaw onto the sandwich, otherwise a frequent failing with Carolina 'cue. 

It's pretty easy to criticize a new restaurant. This one is worth giving a little time to shake out any difficulties.",1
"I heard quiet a few things about this place from people all around. I noticed that they opened one up by where I live. So I decided to check out,""Five Guys Burgers and Fries"". Yes I know there is a typo, and no I am NOT the one who posted the business listing.
{edit}- looks like they fixed the typo, I guess no yummy french feies for me ;)

When I got there they had a long line out the door. The thought that kept racing through my head was that the food better be worth the wait. as I inched my way to the counter which took about 25 minutes.I finally got to the cashier. She was very friendly and explanatory about the menu. She gave me suggestions to order. So I picked what I wanted and placed my order.

I ordered the Bacon cheese burger with cajun fries. They give you multiple options of what you want on your burger. The toppings I chose were grilled onions,grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and mayo. The burger was fantastic! I also tried the cajun fries they were good also! Still the thoughts of that meal dance through my head. They sell hot dogs at five guys, so I might keep that as an option.Also for vegetarians out there they do sell grilled cheese sandwiches and a veggie burger. 

One thing that I will note is that the fries are cooked in peanut oil. Also they have free peanuts available for customers. If you have any allergies to peanuts than this place is probably NOT for you. I just thought I would throw in that disclaimer. Another heads up is how busy this place gets. You may have to take your meal to go given the fact that indoor and outdoor seating may be occupied. The prices are pretty reasonable here because you can get a filling meal for under $10. 

It still boggles my mind that this place is fast food, because it is almost as good as most gourmet burger spots. I will admit that for a chain fast food restaurant this place is top shelf. This place is definitely worth checking out.

In short good food,good prices, and good service. Who could ask for anything more?",1
"I went back and forth before writing this review - but have gotten a sad meal here now three times- first we had pancakes that they didn't mix the things in and brought them out on the side after we waited 25 min, then we got almost well done burgers after asking for med rare and today I ordered French toast to go and it literally tasted like the bread from a grilled cheese. There was nothing French toast about it - it was griddle partially burned challa- completely regular bread in the middle, it didnt have a trace of egg soaked French toast flavor. it was as if they took the bread out of the bag and stuck it on  a greasy  fry top with whatever they used- threw the whole thing in the trash after two bites.",-1
"We drove here because a few people suggested it. The food we ordered was like warm and not very tasty. The gumbo was cold and the place only had about 25 people in the restaurant. The waitress was nice and asked if we needed to speak to the manager. We declined and made the decision to never waste our money at this dump again. When we return to New Orleans, this won't be on our taste buds.",-1
"Where to begin, a $ 7 tip was added to my bill prior to Svc rendered. Shouldn't that be my choice. It is a gratuity is it not? My order took over 2 hours to arrive. When the gentleman arrived he did apologize for the delay. The reason I have never heard before. He told me a coworker took his car to p/u his/her daughter from school. That's a new one. So as you see, 2 hour delay does not = a $7 gratuity, nor does it = more than 1 star.",-1
"I am seriously going to ban myself from eating boiled crab from here on out. It's just so bland but not as bad as eating snow crab claws at seafood buffets. That literally makes me sick.

$23 for the 3 pound crab special that came with clam chowder and a caesar salad. It was the tiniest 1.5 crabs ever. The first crab just had larger claws and a tiny body which means I pretty much paid for 2 huge crab claws. Barely any meat in the body. Second crab was the same thing just cut in half. But whatever meat I did have, it was fresh. I'll give that to them.

Kind of disappointed after this so I went home and fried up my own 3 marinated crabs at $3.99 per pound. Totally made up for it.",-1
"I usually really like 8th & Union - good food, decent prices, & cute atmosphere. Unfortunately, today we had a party for brunch and I was honestly embarrassed I recommended it. The weightier had to take our order several times because he forgot what we said. Then when our food came, several things were missing (i.e. It said it came with bacon but no one got bacon, any add ons people made were missing etc.). I believe every one of us had some kind of problem with the order (party of 10). I'm hoping it was just a bad day or a new person, because I was really disappointed. I will definitely give them a second chance & hopefully have a better experience, otherwise I don't see myself returning. That said - I've had dinner there before & been happy! Great happy hour deals. So again, hoping it's just a fluke.",-1
"Mediocre food. very slow service , our food came one by one Within 10 to 15 minutes of each other. Rude servers and took us a long time to get our bills with lots of mistakes. Overall very bad experience",-1
"I first came here based on a friend's recommendation for lunch. I was super excited to eat a gyros sandwich and check out this local cafe that somehow had slipped my eye all these years. When I first went in, I was fully geared up to order the gyros sandwich, but then I saw the menu and spent a good 5 minutes debating whether or not I should change my mind. The manager (I think) was really patient and offered up some recommendations, and I ended up getting a pita melt with turkey instead. This would just give me an excuse to come back another time to try the gyros.

The pita was great and immediately made me a repeat customer, as I came back a few days later. I love how the restaurant is run by a family and how friendly and talkative they are every time I'm here. The place is never really crowded, as I think most people come here to grab food to go, but its nice to have the option to eat in.

On days that I wanted to trick myself into thinking I was eating healthier, I would order a gyros salad which provided the satisfaction of eating a gyro but with significantly more veggies.

I love Blackberry Cafe especially since it falls in line with my goal of supporting local dining locales. The service and friendliness also really helps. Just expect a brief wait for your food as they prep it when you order so everything comes out fresh. Also, the parking can be a problem since Blackberry Cafe shares a small metered lot with three other places. But this should not deter you from stopping in and grabbing a delicious meal.",1
"This McDonald's is as terrible as they come. They have no care, mess up every order, take at least 10mins to answer you in drive thru at slow points in the day. Stay away smdh!",-1
"I'm wavering between a 3 or 4 star rating. Banana Republic has beautiful clothing, perfect for the modern working woman. However, the price is quite steep - I don't think it justifies the quality (which is decent, but there are way too many cotton items that need to be hand-washed cold and air-dried). Although I fit into ""regular""-sized clothing, my body proportions make it so that petite sizes are sometimes better for me - unfortunately, this store doesn't carry any petites at all. I guess it's buy online, return in-store for me (which is very easily done).

They have a gorgeous selection of costume jewelry - try to catch them when they are having a sale. My other issue is that every time I've been in the store the last 6 months, the sales associates have been completely useless (I used to work at various retail stores so I feel that I can legitimately comment on this). As in, didn't say hello (which I don't care about), didn't tell me about promotions going on (which ordinarily I wouldn't care about, until I'm touching the items and wondering if those are part of the promotion, since there always seems to be exclusions), standing around and chatting when I obviously needed an associate's help (finding a size, getting a fitting room, etc.).

Anyway, I'd probably still keep shopping here... there is only one other BR in town and this one is closer haha",1
"I liked the place and  food, but i cant give more than one star cause the service was terrible. They only have one server, her name is Gabriela. She was very rude with my guests and me. Plus the check came to $180 with 18% tip included and i explained i needed to charge a certain amount in cards and the rest in cash, i even wrote the amounts and card numbers on the ticket but after waiting a long time for her to bring the change she didnt bring any change and overcharged the cards. A total of $210 dlls instead of $180 she was charging more than $50dlls in tip. Thats an abuse. Im very very dissapointed and her only excuse was that she was too busy.",-1
This place is dirty and the wait time because you order bacon with your meal is stupid and hair in food what can I say,-1
"I came in to get my VW beetle windshield replaced and was quoted $139, which is weird because a week ago I was quoted $150 @ the Oracle location, it just seems like everything in South Tucson is priced just right!  
   I arrived at Tony's @ 8:35am, 5 minutes after they open and already there was a customer in the waiting room :/  I was told it was going to take 1.5-2 hrs.  Not to bad i think,  besides there is a Mexican restaurant next door (Jalisco).  
    The waiting room at Tony's is a bit small,  with 5 chairs,  a tv, and all of their candy machines are empty,  what the heck,  what if I was having a crazy sweet tooth today?  Anyways,  they took about 2 hrs which was what they quoted and my windshield looks awesome!",1
"I would have given this 4-stars when it was operated under its former name (which escapes me right now).  The food was still good, but gone are the outstanding individually made margaritas (now they're out of a machine a la ""Fat Tuesday"" style).  Also was a bit disappointed at our service while sitting at the bar...it was anything but crowded there, yet we waited a disproportionate amount of time for service.  Still not a bad place to go while in Phoenixville.",-1
"Great for lunch! Our meals were hearty, tasty, and affordable (most entrees priced around $10).

I had the Hummus Plate which came with 4 falafels, pita bread, and greek salad. But the real star was the Greek Chicken Soup that my husband ordered. The broth reminded me of a creamy Thai soup because it's infused with lemon flavor. Half the customers in the restaurant ordered this and I would definitely go back for seconds!

Can't wait to try dinner at Kanella, especially since Kelly W. says the fish is out of this world.",1
"I would have given this place 4 stars had it not been for 2 things that really bothered me. So background to how we came up to this place.  Came here with my boyfriend when we were in Philadelphia for a business trip. The place is small and cozy. When we got there, it was 9pm and had been walking around in 20degree weather, so we were down for something warm. Here is where half a star leaves the rating. The hostess did not look like she wanted anyone coming in. She had a little attitude when she told us to stand by the ramen wall. When seats were available, the hostess took her sweet time cleaning up despite people waiting to be seated.  I understand the place is a little cramped but it does not take 10mins to clean a table, especially if the table is literally 3x3. The waiter and waitress were wonderful and after we had ordered I was watching the chef cook.  The other half star for the following: The entire time the chef was cooking, she would pull her phone out and text. That's disgusting! She wasn't wearing gloves also. The chef is picking up up ingredients with her hands that she just used to text and puts them into the bowls they're serving! Now onto the food. My bf and both got the miso ramen with the spicy bean paste as an add on. The broth was good but after adding the spicy bean paste and mixing in the egg, it got creamy and even better.  If I was back in Philadelphia, I might consider coming back but probably if it was a last resort.",1
"My husband and I went out to Red Pony on a date night a few months ago and had an exceptional time.  We were first treated to an gnocchi appetizer as the chef was ""trying out"" a new menu.  Delicious.  Shortly after we ordered, the manager informed us that our dinners might take longer than expected - they were dealing with a large party upstairs.  He offered us a complimentary salad, but we declined, as we wanted to save room for dinner.  I was very appreciative that he informed us BEFORE we had waited a long time, or had to ask our waiter where the food was.  Well, it did end up taking quite some time for our dinner, but we enjoyed our drinks, and really didn't mind.  After we received our dinners and had a chance to taste everything, the manager came back and informed us that our entrees were on the house.  Amazing.  You forget sometimes what good customer service is until you have a great experience like this.  The food was delicious.  We will absolutely be back.",1
"This was a pretty tasty, artery-clogging snack. Think tiny mozzarella sticks that have a bit more bang with the ooey-gooey cheese curds. I finally had the chance to try this out at the hustling and bustling Jersey City Project Market, where there were quite a few other food vendors inside and food trucks lined up outside. I was surprised The Cow and The Curd truck had no line, compared to the other vendors and food trucks. Then I noticed the portion size you got for $9 (dipping sauces cost extra). There were 8 very tiny cheese bites that fit in a little paper basket that fit inside my small hand. It seemed you got a better bang for your buck at the other food spots. I'm not sure if these are made to order or just kept warm because when I went up and placed my order, I was immediately handed a basket that was just sitting there. It was gooey inside, but definitely not the kind of hot you'd get from being pulled from the fryer. I'm glad I knocked it off my food bucket list but I probably won't be searching them out again.",1
"Been here 3 times.  First time, I was loved the food so much, I came back.  The 2nd visit was ok. The last visit left a lot to be desired.

Food - 4 out of 5. Delicious but it's touch & go.  I ordered the same thing twice (fried catfish) and got 2 different versions.  The first time I had corn bread, the second time, I didn't.  The first time I had rice, the second time I had mac & cheese.  I have to say that the food is really good, though.

Service - 3 out of 5.  Again, it's touch & go. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad - depending on your server.  When they're super busy, expect to be forgotten by your server for a while.

Cleanliness - 1 out of 5.  The dining area is ok but the bathroom was horrible. I was going to wash my hands but decided to use my anti-bacterial wipes instead because I took one look at the bathroom and could not stand to go inside.

Ambiance - This is your typical mom & pop whole in the wall.  No ambiance here.

Summary:

At first, I was impressed with the food so I came back. When I came back the 2nd and 3rd time, I decided I could probably eat at other establishments with good food, too.",-1
"Ordered take out from this place tonight. It was by far the worst meal I have ever had. I ordered the chicken parmesan. This is a pretty hard dish to screw up but they did a fine job of it. It was an unidentifiable piece of gray rubbery meat (I think). The breading was soggy and I needed a steak knife to cut the chicken. I literally could not chew it, it was so tough. The garlic bread it came with, was also disgusting! It was greasy and hard. Yuck! My husband had a sauted chicken campagniola with veggies which was marginally better. The chicken was so overdone, it made it hard to stomach. The food was so disgustingly greasy that the brown bag they gave us broke. Uggh!  If you get food from this place, be warned. Maybe stick with the pizza.",-1
"I came here for a work dinner and we all enjoyed ourselves. Our service was pretty good! He was really nice and answered our questions but he did offer to go over the specials. I mean the specials were listed at the table but I thought It was weird he didn't say anything about them. The waiter said the rigatoni was their most popular dish, so naturally I ordered It. I thought It was good but safe, It wasn't busting with flavor. My coworker ordered the octopus ink pasta and said he felt like It was undercooked. Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and I would go back!",1
Hostess staff less than cordial (girl with the 'Sideshow Bob' hair acts like she really doesn't give a Debbie Wasserman Schultz about her job); wait staff mediocre and tried to charge us for something not ordered that a manager gave us to make up for poor performance; foo foo food with a fancy cook's name; waste of expensive space,-1
Co-workers and I placed a big order. The meal in particular was an apple cinnamon pancake with eggs and bacon for $9.99. When made thr fool mistake of trusting that everything was going to be correct with the order and when we finally opened the bag at work in that order was the pancake.. Can you imagine spending $10 on 1 pancake?? Well I called this establishment the following morning because they close at 2:30 and was instantly bombarded with negativity and rudeness from the lady who answered who placed blame on everyone else and then said JUST COME GET THE EGGS AND BACON... The rudest I've encountered in a while.,-1
"Scheduled a consult with this firm, was 20 minutes late. Thank god it was just a phone consult. Receptionist was rude and didn't seem to value my time. No apology was given for the tardiness. Told her that i was going to look elsewhere and she said ok and hung up. 

Maybe they don't care about clients for traffic tickets. If i had been given an apology or felt like they actually cared, i would have continued with them. 

Let's see if they respond to this review.",-1
"Good food undone by poor service.

I don't blame our server entirely for the 40-minute wait between when we were seated and when most of our food arrived, but we had to ask her after 30 minutes to check. Six of our party of seven got their food. The seventh got her burger 15 minutes later because the kitchen burned it. 

Other than the cold french fries with the late burger, no one had any complaints about the quality of the food. 

Unless you can take an extended lunch, I would not recommend coming here at that time of day.",-1
"On 3/5 (big snow day in Nashville) a couple of friends and I went to Local Taco in Sylvan Park for dinner.  When we arrived, the place was jam packed, and we knew there would be quite the wait.  I live right by Local Taco, and frequent the place.  Food is always delicious, along with the margaritas!  The Shrimp Taco is my favorite, along with the Local BBQ (try it out!)... 

My friend got her food on a separate ticket, and awhile went by, and I still had not received mine.  It took a little longer than usual, but I figured it was because they were so slammed.  A few minutes later, the girl who took my order came out and saw my number was still on the table.  She asked if I had gotten my food yet, and I said no, and she apologized and said she'd be right back.  Then Bryan Haas (I'm guessing he was the manager at the time), came out with our food, apologizing.  Long story short - I received AWESOME customer service from the Local Taco staff, and Bryan Haas especially.  They comp'd our food for the delay, and gave a gift card to return as well.    I told him the gift card wasn't necessary, but he insisted. Bryan also slipped his business card in there, which I thought was very professional and sincere.

  I just wanted to give a shout out to one of my favorite restaurants and the all-star staff that works there.  Going above and beyond for your customers is what makes everyone love Local Taco so much :)  Thanks!  And see y'all soon!",1
"Pizza was pretty good... not the best Chicago style that I've had, but it was definitely a good meal. The arancini appetizer, however, was so good! I wish I didn't live so far away, I would try everything they have to offer!

The service was great. Our waitress was very personable and friendly.",1
"I ordered the club sandwich which includes cold turkey, bacon and cheese on French bread. The sandwich was delicious, the service friendly and the ambiance lovely. That said, waiting 20 minutes in line, plus an additional 30 minutes at mule table for a cold turkey sandwich wasn't worth it. Many of their items are cold sandwiches, and considering it takes about 30 seconds to put some turkey on bread and sit it in a plate, it must be a staffing or organizational issue. They appear to deliver orders sequentially, which doesn't seem to make sense here holding up cold items for the occasional hot one. For me it was just over rated and far slower than it needed to be such a basic item.",-1
"First, this review is for the market, not the dining room, and my order was to go.  My advice is that if you love this place, do not place a to go order here.  I've been eating here pretty regularly and have never tried to order take out until my most recent visit.  One of the people in the group needed to get home quickly but we had been planning on Maynard's and figured we'd stick with it.  I never considered that the market didn't do carryout and I certainly wasn't trying to be difficult. It was my mistake and I'm not trying to be a jerk about asking for a service that isn't offered, I really didn't know.  I guess the market just seemed like a carryout friendly menu.    Anyway, my issue is the way the lady behind the counter handled the situation.  
I could have handled a polite, we don't do carryout.   However, she was really rude and clearly irritated.  There was seriously no need for all of that.  She went on about how the menu isn't intended for carryout and they don't have proper take out containers.  Ok, I get that you don't do carryout.  Really, I've brought home leftovers plenty of times in what I would consider to be very proper containers so it's not necessary to make up reasons why you're annoyed that I asked for carryout. Just tell me that it's not something you offer and I'll come back next time I can dine in.  

The vibe in this place is usually so fun; it was sad to be in there both ordering and listening to other people order. She was pretty short with the guy who ordered after us too.  He was dining in but had some questions about the menu; possibly she was still irritated after my order.    Not a good experience.  We love it here so I'm guessing we'll be back.  But lesson learned, dine in only.  And if I see the same person behind the counter I'm heading across the street to Congress which is where we ended up that afternoon.",1
"I wish I could write two reviews, because my two experiences here were night and day.

My partner and I went here twice during our trip. The first time was great. Bar was busy, but we snagged a spot to stand and got great service. Between the delicious cocktails (peanut infusion is a real treat), the upbeat music, and friendly patrons and staff, we thought we had found our spot for the rest of our trip.

The second time was much different. Although the bar was pretty empty, the two bartenders ignored us after our first drink order, chatting up and serving other patrons, but letting our drinks sit empty for over 15 minutes, despite our efforts to catch their eye. It appeared they'd determined middle-aged patrons were a better source of tips and saved their charm for them. When one server finally checked in with us (asking abruptly if we were okay, not suggesting another cocktail or anything to make us feel welcome), our mood had been soured and so we passed on the second drink we'd been planning and moved on to Batch up the street, where the cocktails are just as good and the bartender was happy to serve them.

Sad to offer a less than hearty recommendation because our first trip here was so great. Another review here suggested different experiences based on bartenders, so I guess we're not alone in finding up hut and miss. We will peak in the window to identify rage bartender before entering on our next trip,",1
"We were led here by the glowing Yelp reviews and the fact that we had a wonderful meal at Mad Fish last year (owned by the same person as 1200). What a mistake.

First off the place is tiny and extremely loud.  I ordered the sea bass, but they were out of it - at 7pm?  Next I tried to order the grouper special - again out of it.  Richard, our waiter told me (confidentially per him) that he could give me the 8 oz lobster tail for $24 along with the mashed potato side and my choice of broccoli or asparagus.  Chose the asparagus.  Chip
Ordered the Berkshire pork chop with a pepper rub, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My lobster was good, but no way was this tail 8 oz before cooking.  Chip's pork chop was a spectacle of gristle and fat.  Despite its huge size he probably got about a half portion due to the bad cut of meat.  His potatoes were pretty good. His asparagus were missing, but when he saw the sad little overcooked spears I received, he figured he'd pass.

When Richard came back and asked if we wanted a box for the uneaten gristle and fat we told him it wasn't necessary and explained why.  To his credit, he apologized and removed the $15 charge for my glass of Groth Sauvignon Blanc, which we thanked him for and appreciated the gesture.

When we got the bill I noticed that I was given an additional charge for the asparagus, even though that was not mentioned when he offered the choice of broccoli or asparagus.

I should say that the house chopped salad, rolls and maple butter were delicious and that's what made me give 1200 two stars instead of one.

Avoid at all costs.  Between the noise factor, lack of listed entrees at 7pm and the bs crap with the vegetable, there are many other places that deserve your tourist dollars more.",-1
"This place honestly was a disappointment! Very thin cuts of meat for the price compared to other places. The food came out cold too. Had the Dolsot Bibimbap and the stone pot was cold to the point I could've picked it up and not get burned. 

When you order a dolsot bibimbap of any kind, the rice at the bottle should be able to get crunchy....nope not here. 

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, please save your money and go somewhere else.",-1
"This place used to be nice but over the years it has degraded a little. 

I actually like sitting in the bar when not to many people are in there smoking. I think you get much better service and heck half price apitizers are pretty awesome.

The last time we went I was not feeling great as it was and eating endless chips, waiting for drink refils and waiting almost 45 minutes for food was pretty bad. I wouldn't say that the service sucked but it could have been way better.

I took most of my meal home and it never reheats very well in the micro-wave at work. 

Over all I think this place is ok but I am loosing interest in it and need a new mexican go to spot. Heck this is more fake mexican anyway.

Hope if I go again that we get our food faster.",-1
"I chose to try this salon out because it was close to home and I needed my solar nails removed and I wanted gel instead. They clearly didn't know how to remove solar as they spent an hour scraping it off after the initial  soak. They proceed to do gel, but she coated my skin more than the nail and after several redos finally finished. A few days later, the gel is coming up. Never will return.",-1
"I dined here yesterday with two friends and we all ordered shrimp and grits. When our orders were brought out, the shrimp and grits were cold and hard and looked as if they had been sitting out for a while. We sent them back and asked if they could send us fresh grits but unfortunately the new grits were the same. It was pretty insulting that they would even think that we should eat food of that quality. I have visited this restaurant many times in my past visits to New Orleans, but I will not return.",-1
"I have been going to this nail salon for years off and on. I came here back when it was called Tropical Nails and Tom was the owner. Now its Grant Nails and has a different owner. When I started getting my nails done again I lucked out and found an experienced technician named Amy. I stuck with her because she did good nails. Then about 2 months ago Amy left. So I let the owner Angela do my nails. The first time was ok. Then the second time she did them the gel polish (which she talked me into getting instead of regular polish) started to chip within a day. I called and complained, she redid the polish and again within one or two days it was chipping. Now my nails look at mess. I don't trust her to correct the problem. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to find a new nail place. Very upsetting and disappointing.",-1
"Most the food here is great, we always have issues getting our steaks cooked properly even going by their steak chart. We order medium-rare and it comes out raw so we send it back then it comes out well-done. We end up with the manager having to go back and make sure the cooks are paying attention and then it seems to come out the way we order it or at least close enough we can eat it. The appetizers are wonderful if you can get them cooked properly. Even the manager was shocked how ours looked. The manager apologize but this is a regular occurrence at this restaurant.",-1
"Let me start by saying, I cant wait to go back to am@fm! For technically being in a food court in the Farmers Marker, Arnold Myint sure did step it up. He has created a casual, yet upscale counter restaurant in a food court. Bravo! 

I ordered half of a turkey sandwich and a side of the chick pea and feta salad. Everything was extremely fresh, which I would hope for being in the farmers market. If you choose to eat at their counter, which we did, you get a real place setting, not a recycled paper box. Its like you are eating at a nice restaurant, but paying the same price you would pay at come crappy fast-food joint. 

The service was great. They kept asking us if we were enjoying our meals, they even gave us a taste of their Mexican Chocolate & Coconut brownie. Which by the way, was delicious. 

I could be considered a geek by some, because of how fascinated I am with new innovate technology, so needless to say I was more than excited when the waiter sat an iPad in front of me. The screen showed a breakdown of all the food we ordered and you just swipe your card to pay. Then they text/email your receipt to you. How cool is that?

So, for a fresh delicious meal under ten bucks, head down to the Farmers Market and check out am@fm.",1
"The stone-faced hostess directed us to our seats and brought over a high chair, clearing a space for it after my husband had already made a space for it.  Well maybe she didn't notice.  Nary a vegetable on the kids menu so had to order off the regular menu for my kids and when I ordered my 3 YO daughter a whole milk the waiter brings it out in an open GLASS cup without a straw in sight.  It was brunch and there was one other table that Presidents Day morning.  Yet our food took quite a while to come out. It was sitting on the counter for a several minutes being discussed under 4-5 different staff people.  It's pretty clear they don't ""get"" kids here.  My huevos rancheros were average, certainly not worth $18; my husbands monte Cristo was good.  It was our one brunch meal in Philly so had wanted it to be a good one - wish I had gone elsewhere.",-1
I dropped off a suit that I needed cleaned last week and was told to pick it up on Friday. When I came in I was told it wasn't ready yet and I could pick it up on Saturday. I come back on Saturday to find them closed for 3 days. Now I have to go buy a new suit for a funeral today. This is very unacceptable,-1
"My wife and I have a specific location we go to in VA.  Whenever we ""cheat"" on them, we are always disappointed.  However, on our recent trip to Tampa, our host said this place was good from what she heard.  After looking at the reviews from a few spots in the area, we decided to give it a try for my wife's birthday.  

One thing I will say is that this place is expensive!  So is our spot in VA.  However, we felt we got our monies worth here.  We waited about 10min or so and we were seated (it was a Thursday night).  Our waiter was Lou.  From the time we sat down to the time we paid, he kept us laughing.  I forgot our chef's name but he was awesome as well.  

The food was great!  I didn't expect the noodles which was a plus.  I also ordered Supreme California Rolls and my friend ordered something else.  Both were up to par with my standards.  

For the main meal, the steak, chicken and shrimp was cooked perfect!  The yum yum sauce I'm used to isn't as watery but it was still good.  

I did order 2 Sake Bombs and when asked if I ever done one, I said I sure have back home in VA.  Lou said we haven't done one FL style..lol.  Lou then got everyone together to chant along (2 tables) as we did the Sake bomb.  We made a mess but Lou was there with replacement napkins.  He also got everyone at the table to sing happy birthday to my wife which was cool.  Then again the people at our table were cool to begin with.

Overall, I loved this place.  It was pricey but well worth it in my books.  If you ever go, ask for Lou as your waiter.  You WILL NOT be disappointed with him.",1
"A few years ago my parents, my brothers and i went to this restaraunt for my birthday. We ordered the usual huge spread because we love thai food. But there was a surprise in the tea. A roach, swimming around. The server brought a new pot (no apology) and that was all. No taking the tea off the bill, no acknowledgement of what happened, nothing. We haven't eaten there since.",-1
"The wait is sometimes outrageously long (an hour or longer) and there has been more than one occasion where the hostess forgot to call our group when the table was ready. 

But after the disappointment of waiting so long and dealing with a terrible hostess, I always leave happy as the food is so good.

Get the orange juice everytime",1
"This place is complete trash. I just recently bought a 2015 Toyota Corolla s and I got free oil change cards and a bunch of coupons. Charged me $60 for an oil change WITH A FREE OIL CHANGE COUPON, they told me it's high synthetic ow-20 oil so it's gonna be extra. They said it runs $12 a quart, I can buy a 5 quart oil (the exact same they used) at Walmart for $20..?!?! They thought i was an idiot and proceeded to tell me more bogus stuff I needed for my car like a filter (which I knew wasn't even my filter so they switched my air filter out and took mine!) and that I needed new wipers and I had just put new wipers on. They left my pristine clean engine a mess with fluids all over and dirtied my car and changed all the settings inside. So of course a free oil change turned out to be $60 with a recommended $200 for other things. The managers here at the desk WILL RIP YOU OFF. I watched as they did the same thing to everyone else. DO NOT GO HERE!!!! I WARN YOU!!!!",-1
"I went to the Philadelphia Record Exchange for the first time yesterday. I took the stairs down to the basement to peruse their vinyl offerings, and from the stairs, things looked promising. However, I was quite disappointed when I actually started flipping through the bins. I didn't see anything that piqued my interest, and the few albums that did could be purchased at any record store for $1 to $2 less. Boo. I'm happy to support local record stores, but I'd rather go to Beautiful World Syndicate, whose selection is way better.",-1
"Stopped by here for a coffee break and the reviews did not disappoint. The service was awesome, I changed my drink order and they didn't even sweat it! They have these Delish cookies you have to try called the s'more rocher.. so yummy that I ended up buying all of them!! I ordered the matcha latte and looks do not deceive! A must go chill spot away from the crowd!",1
"Myself and a family member went into Table Talk to purchase a new living room table about a month ago, the table was one from reclaimed Indian Teak, and we were very excited about the table! After speaking to the owners, managers, and a few employees they loved the idea of the table. We got a great deal, paid the down, and waited the 4 weeks to hear back from them saying that our order was in and ready to be delivered.

Then the phone rang. It was the owner (I cannot remember his name, he was an older gentlemen), and told us that they couldnt get the base of the table, and wouldnt be able to put the table together. He said that they could still sell us the top of the table, but there would be no discount. We were rather confused about the request, and politely declined to purchase the table from them at that point. Back to the drawing board!

So, we did some research and found the table from their vendor through a friend who purchases wholesale furniture. The cost was the same that they charged us from the wholesale vendor, that Table Talk wanted to charge us! Now, that doesnt make much economic sense to us. 

In conclusion, we found it odd that they would 1. Lie to us, saying that they couldnt get the table, when they just mischarged us, 2. Attempted to scam us out of the difference in cash instead of just taking the loss on their business, and 3. That they would so disregard the common good practices of business. 

If you are looking for unique furniture, there are so many better places that have ethics and integrity. Avoid Table Talk at all costs!",-1
"My fiancé and I went to Spraga last night..needless to say it was our first and last time dining at this establishment.  We were pretty pumped to go here since we live right down the street and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at Fat Ham a few weeks ago.  The food was good but not show stopping.  My major issues were with the service.  1 word.  Unbelievable.  We spent $180 on 2 people.  When you spend that much money on a meal.. You expect perfection with food, service and ambiance.  This place underwhelmed and now I have to deal with my fiancé who is still raging with last nights experience.  Thanks Spraga.

Issues:
1.  Soups came before cocktails.  I finally had to ask a manager where our cocktails we're because it so long.  - not in my world if I'm paying $180!  
2.  First course came while we were still eating our soup..so we had 2 plates in front of us on a cramped table.  Hello serving 101 at like the most basic restaurant in the world..Don't bring the next course when people are still eating their first!  Again I would expect shit like this to happen if I were at TGI Fridays but I wasn't at TGI Fridays.  I was at SPRAGA.
4. The waiter tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them.  Say what?  Not when I'm paying $180 on a meal son!  You leave the plate until I am finished!
5.  The waiter would awkwardly come to the table and just stand there.. Obviously we know he came to take our food order or dessert order but you say "" Is everyone ready?.. I'd like to take your order"" etc.  WTF.  Nope he just stood there... Weird!  
6.  Empty glasses/butter dishes left on the table throughout the meal.  Sloppy.  The server tries to take plates we are still eating from but leaves sangria glasses etc for the entire meal?  I just.  Don't.  Get it.  

All in all food was good, not amazing and I've had better service at Tangier.  If you are going to spend that much money go somewhere else.",-1
"That's the last time I go there. I went to mail a package, and when I went to pay the $5. 55 cent charge, he said ""Oh, you want to use that debit card? That will cost you an extra $1.00.

So now they are penalizing you for using debit? From now on, I will drive my butt back to the post office and mail my stuff like I used to.",-1
"Been here twice...once just for drinks and once for lunch. Both times were great. Nice and strong drinks reasonably priced. For lunch, had the tri-tip sandwich. Was excellent choice as tri-tip was so thinly sliced it was more like roast beef and even came with au-jus, which was one of the best seasoned I have ever had...it wasn't just beef broth. Wasn't able to choose between salad and fries for the side and waitress said they could split and do both, which was a plus.

Away from the hustle and bustle of State St. and easier to find parking. Great patio for lunch and great bar inside where the locals hang out.",1
"Super tasty ice cream and mammoth shakes! We had the New Yorker, with strawberry cheesecake, and it was definitely enough for two people. Service was nice, and the ladies at the counter were helpful. It took us about 5 minutes to get our shake with one other person in line. Parking is plentiful. Only complaints I have are that we had a hard time finding a place to sit because tables were not clean, and the noise level was pretty high. Otherwise, a pretty cool stop.",1
"First we shared a Blossom Onion (delicious ). Then we had rib eye steaks and they were cooked to perfection and had a great taste. 
We went on a Sunday about 2:00pm and were seated right away and service was OK. The waitress took our order in a timely manner but never came back to check on us to see if we needed anything until we asked for the bill.
They have a Early Bird menu for $8.99 until 3:00pm but we wanted the Ribeye's ( not on the Early Bird Menu ) 
Will go back again.",1
"Popped in for dinner after our ""Mall Santa"" experience and we were not disappointed. Hubby ordered the Ciopinno, I ordered the steamers and we got a Margarita Pizza for the tiny human. Ciopinno and Steamers were spot on! The pizza was good, but they do serve it on a different type of crust (I apologize for not knowing, but I was not concerned with the crust when ordering) that I was not used to, but mini me didn't mind one bit. You could tell the ingredients were fresh and as we ate the place continued to fill up. 
   Our server was a very pleasant man with a sense of humor we understood. Charlotte, the other server who came on the floor about mid way through our meal, was absolutely amazing! She might have a great thing for little humans, and that's ok with us. Charlotte cartered to our little peanut and made her (and us) feel special. 
  We shall return again soon M3. We'll done.",1
"We came in just before noon and there was just one other couple in the restaurant. The drive thru traffic was slow.   However, EVERY single table was dirty.  We asked for a cloth to clean off a table with. You'd think that might encourage them to send someone out to do some cleanup, but no. We wiped our table ourselves and returned the cloth to the counter. 

After this, the restaurant got busier, and the tables remained filthy. Someone finally came out to wipe down tables about halfway through our meal, after several more customers had to wipe down their own tables. 

As for the food, I wasn't impressed with that either. I ordered the mini sirloin burgers and they arrived over cooked and dry, even the buns were burnt in places. Plus, only 1 of the 3 burgers actually had any grilled onions on it, and then only a very small amount. Most of the toppings lay at the bottom of the carton. 

The whole experience was very unsatisfying and I would be reluctant to come back here anytime soon.",-1
"Road-trip thru philly, found this on yelp, tried it and we're very glad we did! We both got the smoked duck salad, and split the rapini bruschetta and white bean dip, accompanied by Peeper ale.  Everything was wonderful, just as the other reviewers said. We thought it couldn't get any better, when they brought out the lemon blueberry panna cotta - pure heaven!  Next time we go thru philly THIS is where we'll be stopping.",1
"This is the worst Chik-fil-A I have ever been to. On multiple occasions I have waited over 25 minutes to get my food. Their response is ""Sorry, we got backed up."" It seems they are backed up on every occasion. They even have the sandwiches pre-made waiting to go in the bags but somehow, among all 10 employees behind the counter, they are so backed up that a five minute wait turns to a 25 plus minute wait. Avoid at all cost. Much better options at the Union!",1
"Been here twice now.  Both times I ordered a caesar salad with chicken, and both times it was a bust.  Some of the produce was wilted, browning and bitter, and just doused in dressing beyond anything reasonable.

Counter service was so-so.  First time I went in, there were two staff members taking their time.  I was third in line, and it took almost 20 minutes to walk out with my to-go order.  Second time I was in, there was literally no one behind the counter or anywhere in sight for almost 10 minutes.  

No bueno, Fresh Bar.  Thanks anyway.",1
Chili was watery with grissley meat.  Sent back and exchanged for chicken tortilla. Ice in soda was mildew.  Asked for manager and he said he couldn't smell the mildew. Baloney.  The ice was contaminated.  Don't eat here!!!!,-1
"I've been coming to Heads & Tails since they opened; I followed Jenne from her old salon because she is, hands down the best waxer I've ever found. I also love that Heads & Tails uses the hard wax. My skin is super sensitive and I've burned a couple times with regular wax (I actually have a scar to prove it).

I've also had my lashes tinted by Erin, and she did an amazing job!

The only problem I have with the salon is the difficulty with getting an appointment - not because they're busy, I understand that part - but because no one ever answers the phone! H&T doesn't have a dedicated receptionist, so usually I have to call 3-4 times for an appointment. It's getting to the point where it's really frustrating. They do have an answering machine, but I can't take callbacks at work.",1
"So I've tried this place a couple times before I decided to write review. In a scale of 1-5 I give the food a 2, but I guess for the price I can't complain or expect more. Lunch plate is $6.50. The one small piece of baked chicken tasted stale and saturated with salt and garlic, the cassava (yuka) was over cooked and mushy. Second time I tried the pulled pork which was a much bigger serving than the chicken but dry and chewy. I wouldn't even attempt to try the fish. I work in the area and we kind of make this place a last option when ordering lunch. There are a couple Latin places near by that serve way better food for around the same price.",-1
"Walked into the restaurant, with reservations, and many open tables.  I asked the manager for a window table and was responded with ""they are all reserved.""  Two hours later, when we left, still many open tables next to the windows.

Overall food was good.
I had the filet and she had the salmon.
The bottle of wine that was recommended was $75 and was not told prior to ordering it, just that it was the last bottle.",1
"This is the place for authentic Indian street food. I've been here multiple times ordering different things ranging from bhel puri, pav bhaji, vada pav, deconstructed samosa and aloo tikki, dabeli, kulfi and more. Everything was made exceptionally well.

I regret not having found this place sooner.",1
"My wife and her friends returned to try this place again and her report is that it's worse than before.  The staff is a bunch of inexperienced kids for whom this must be their first job, the food is still crappy (but not microwaved, the owner will tell you that), and the bathrooms and tables are still dirty.  What can you expect from a place that got dinged by the board of health for cooking with camp stoves?  Save your money, the place isn't learning from their mistakes.",-1
I love this place as it's one of the few with the French bistro feel in the lou. The beignets were hot and fresh but some raw dough in the middle. Don't inhale or you'll choke on the powdered sugar. If ordered a burger with bacon and egg as my dish and we also had lattes which were kind of light for my taste. Maybe too much milk. I enjoy the ambiance here and the fries. Get fries and mussels if you like mussels. Very nice server and accommodated our toddler with the kids proof cup. I'm big on this now. I want to eat out at nice places with my child so being offered a high chair automatically is a new rubric for me on service.,1
Service was so poor we didn't even get to the food. New Years Day 2017 around 7:30 and we get seated. It's 8:15 now and we still don't have water and multiple waiters have introduced themselves to us saying they're going to be our server for the evening. After wasting 45 mins and repeated attempts to get water for the largest party in the small restaurant we walked out and went across the street to Dat Dog and were blown away by hot dogs. Thanks Dat Dogs!,-1
"Not sure why the reviews are so high for this place.. Great live band, ok food and bad service. Only a few other tables taken but waited 10+ minutes to order drinks. The fish tacos were tasty; pan-seared scallops were over-seasoned and disappointing.",-1
"Let me start with the positives. This little restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's very cute and quaint on the inside. Our server was polite and friendly. He kept the soda refills coming, and did a good job overall. However, this is where the praise ends.

I went to this restaurant because I was in the area and wanted some Italian food. I saw the four star average reviews and figured it would be tasty. Be warned. It is WAY overpriced, and the food wasn't even good. The mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like the frozen ones you buy at the grocery store. They were $7.99 for five small sticks. Not worth it. Then came the entrees. Everything on the menu had cute names and sounded delicious. My husband ordered Chicken Parm, and I had the Baked Ziti. It was awful. I mean... not good at all. His chicken was ""ok,"" but not crispy on the outside like parm should be. Mine didn't have the brown, bubbly, cheesy top you'd normally see on baked ziti. The mozzarella cheese was barely even melted. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar. It was weak and not very flavorful. I had about five bites and didn't even take my leftovers home for the kids. 

Save your money and go to Olive Garden instead. I like to support local businesses, but this was an unpleasant dining experience. Let me say again, it was ridiculously expensive and the food was just BAD. I seriously left there wishing I'd gone to McDonald's instead.",-1
"The secret to GIgi and Big R is NOT to order the fried chicken. The fried chicken is still a very solid choice, but nothing too special. Instead go with the jerk chicken. It's just a little bit spicy and it's oh-so-tender and juicy. 

For sides, I almost always go with the mac n' cheese and the dirty rice. The mac n' cheese is much like the fried chicken, very solid but nothing special. However, the dirty rice is amongst the best I've had, and yes, I have had Bojangles.

Also, skip the sandwich. It's just...chicken between two slices of plain white bread. Get the platter! 

Yes, you can expect to wait for your food at Gigi's, but it's worth it!",-1
"This we one of the worst experiences I have ever had with a Hilton brand.  I used to travel quite frequently  and was a diamond member for a long time.  I no longer travel therefore I don't maintain a ""high status"" with hhonors any longer.   I have always been loyal to the Hilton brands and have always loved ed Embassy Suites specifically.
Unfortunately,  this particular visit  didn't even come remotely close to what I have come to expect from this hotel brand.  I booked a room 3 weeks in advance and got to the lobby at about 4:30Pm on 3/12.  This adventure started as we arrived in the lobby to stand in line behind about 10 other folks and 1 gentleman trying to check people in while a young lady (supervisor or manager) was dealing with an obviously upset customer.
once I got to the counter, the gentleman asked my name and obviously could not find my reservation and asked for my confirmation number.  I provided it and he magically found.  But the room is not ready.  He asked for my phone number so he could when it was ready.  We had a room under a different name which was also not ready and did the same thing.  At about 6PM, my companion stated he didn't have a good feeling so we called the hotel.  The gentleman we spoke with had no idea what we were talking about but took our number again.  
Shortly there after we headed back towards the hotel and my friend received a text stating his roo  was ready.  we got back and there was still a line of about 15 people so we decided to have a drink.  We finished our drinks and went up to the side counter and watched an irritated traveler state his case as the desk clerk simply looked at him.  Now came our turn.  
We got up to the desk clerk and gave him my name and was told my room was not ready.  I asked why not as it was now after 7PM.  He simply stated that all the rooms had not been cleaned.  I then stated this was unacceptable and asked when it would be ready.  He simply said he didn't know and there was nothing ready now.  Clearly, these guy wasn't going out of his way to try anything.  I asked for a Supervisor and a young lady came out and magically got me a room.  She did offer a voucher for the restaurant which was nice of her but this should've never happened.
while we used our voucher, we found out that this was pretty typically of the check-in process and the employee we spoke to had only seen the owner 1 time in 4 years and the only Manager on staff that night was the Food and beverage Manager.  As it appeared the hotel was booked to capacity and we're clearly having check-in issues for 2 days in and row (ands we were told), or even would think management might want to be more involved.
the icing on the cake came when I got my bill the next day and saw I was charged an additional $24 for valet parking that was not optional.
My advice is to look at some other options in the downtown Tampa area as there are good choices there.  this is not one of them.",-1
"Sunday not so fun day at Schlafly. Came in, cool music live outside. Go inside to grab a bite and drink.  We sat inside for around 15 minutes, no server. They had like 4 bartenders, two waitresses and 2 bar backs. Yet, no one even approached.   I do not recommend maplewood on Sunday at all. Bad experience.",-1
"I'm a rather skeptical of new restaurants and usually will wait until the ""masses"" have been before I venture in the door.  Was in O'Fallon, IL last Monday night and finished about 9 PM, so a friend of mine and I decided to try Cheddar's on Route 159 in Fairview Heights, IL.  Walked in at 9 PM and there was still a 30 minute wait for a dining room table (even on a school night)  .  So we decided to sit at the bar for immediate seating.  Best thing we did!

Jessica immediately made us feel at home and helped to explain their concept and certain dishes that she enjoys.  I had the Cagen chicken with black beans and chopped tomatoes . . . sounds rather boring, but the taste was AMAZING!!!  And the entire dish had only 490 calories!  Jessica suggested we try one of the $.99 desserts - I had the strawberry shortcake and it too was amazing!  Can't be the price, right?

So when it came time to return to O'Fallon, IL last night - we had to go to Cheddar's!  We walked in at 9:30 PM on a Saturday night and it was full, but we also ate in the bar again this time.  We walked in and a server we used to have at Chava's in Soulard is now working at the bar in Cheddar's!  Great to see Steven again.

Had the same exact dishes as we did Monday night and I can't wait to go to Cheddar's again REAL soon.  

My only complaint is that the restaurant is beautiful . . . sometimes the food takes a long time one you order to get your order served . . . and the lighting is too dark with the dark woodwork in the restaurant.  They need to retrofit their halogen lighting to LED MR16 bulbs - can you tell I'm in that business?  LOL.

Love Cheddar's and can't wait to go again . . . but sit at the bar for immediate seating!",1
"Very disappointing. You sit down and they have an abbreviated menu they are out if thing. The meatloaf that they say was featured on the travel channel was awful, under seasoned and a joke. Yes, I got suckered. I added a ton of salt and pepper and now just feel robbed. No way that was featured on TV! Would never go back.",-1
What a nightmare!  This is a dirty nasty smelly station  paid cash for gas but the pumps all stopped and nobody could finish pumping. The lady the owner who was a witch said they had to reset the pumps. I wish I had not paid cash. I had to wait half an hour to get my remaining cash back. It happened to every pump. Avoid this nasty store at all costs,-1
The food is very good but the ability to turnover the tables is a huge problem on busy days. Waited over an hour to be seated today and about an hour to get food. I just do not have 2 hours available to get breakfast. They do not have the proper staffing to quickly get the food out and clear tables in a timely fashion. There were many upset people there due to the time to wait. While we were eating there were 2 empty tables for at least 15 minutes that they did not seat anyone at yet when we left there was a longer line than when I arrived which we waited an hour to be seated. The workers were trying but were simply overwhelmed. Management needs to do a better job handling the staffing schedules. I will not be coming back due to this experience.,-1
"First time here, excited to try the place as another new restaurant in the area.  It's a cool looking interior, very open planned & great use of space.  

While waiting for our table, grabbed a quick drink at the bar, took over 15 minutes to be served, even when took our order continued to serve others before got our drink.  When got to the table, on the edge of the restaurant, with one of us facing the wall, quickly realized that we weren't going to be treated as a large number of the other customers.  There were 3 front of house/ managers floating between the tables checking out certain select customers, blatantly demonstrating that only a few customers were worth paying attention to.

To be fair our waiter was great, attentive & making sure we had everything we needed.  Only criticism for him was around not serving the lady first, but that seems to be the case in nearly all restaurants these days!

The food was ok, disappointing that we had not finished our starter before the main came to the table, our waiter apologized, but didn't feel like had much choice as would have gone back under the lights until we were ready!

I get it, it's the Main Line, what do you expect, but we've eaten in a ton of restaurants in Philly including all the top ones & have never seen this kind of pretentiousness before!",-1
"For all the New Orleans food I had...this place was extra regular. I must have asked Tommy waitress for a drink menu 3 or 4 times before I got it. Nothing on the menu looked appetizing or different so I ended up going with the Mac n cheese side. Unfortunately, it tasted like kraft Mac n cheese. If you're here for a short amount of time in nola, try something more authentic",-1
"First, I want to clarify that the service was great! Unfortunately the food sucked so hard that they only came out with the rare one-star rating. 
I was really, really disappointed in the quality of food! It was basically inedible...the best thing was my daughter's French toast (which was still just average). My meal was hash browns covered in peppers & onions, salsa and cheese. The peppers & onions weren't fully cooked, the hash browns were like mush and it was smothered in plain old pace salsa from a jar. Sick. And so, so disappointing. Also incredibly over priced at $10 for a breakfast meal. We had 2 adult and 1 child meals, and used a free meal coupon and the bill still managed to be over $20?! When we go to Cracker Barrel around the corner the tab is $22 (no coupons or discounts) and we get way more food of much higher quality. Breakfasts will be at Cracker Barrel from now on!",-1
"Okay, first review, and I don't even live in Philly anymore. But now in Houston, I'm feeling the loss. 

I'd say there are two categories of doctorliness which make this a 5-star review. First, the impersonal stuff. Modern office, computerized charting, accurate scheduling (I was never kept waiting), the ability to make an appointment at short notice to get something looked at, convenient location. Can't think of anything that's lacking. She shares her office with another doctor who I haven't met.

The second category is the personal aspect. When I showed up the first time as a new patient, she spent a good deal of time with me and I got the feeling she cared about me as a person. Sweet. In all subsequent visits, that never changed. Without going into medical details, she herself called me when the results came in for some minor (and false) tests. 

All in all, I can't imagine a better doctor. Why is it I found a badass doctor and a badass dentist in the one place I didn't live for any length of time?",1
"We were looking for a piece for our new home and we just happen to pop in at Carre d'artistes and we were immediately greeted by Debbie. She let us roam the gallery and was available for any questions. We did not feel pressured to buy anything and once we realized that we were attracted to the work of Shahine, Debbie was there to help figure out what piece we were interested in seeing in a frame. Debbie inquired about our style, where the painting would go and the look we were trying to capture to showcase in our home?

After almost an hour in there, we decided to think about the piece we were looking at and Debbie put the painting on hold for us and offered to text us within 24 hours. We left, continued our holiday shopping and came back within the hour to make our purchase. Debbie was just as excited as we were about  making this purchase. ""Petit Bonhomme"" by Shahine is so beautiful and we cannot wait for it to be a  part of our collection. Debbie helped us pick out a beautiful frame and we felt confident about our purchase/investment. 

We look forward to coming back and building our collection throughout the years.",1
"came here for good reviews. sorry but was not happy with my cut. not faded.i always say if they don't do a good fade, haircut is a shame. 2 minute massage. didn't last long enough. 
never coming back",-1
"been going here since the year 2000 ( i think thats when it opened orignally). The theater is okay. It is not dirty like these other reviews say, if it was i wouldn't be caught dead in here. snack prices are ridiculous however.. like to get a small popcorn is like $6-7, don't even talk about getting a two drinks and 2 of them, thats like almost $20. They once had this thing where you pay $4 and get unlimited small popcorns, then they added you must buy a drink ($3-4 + $4) for unlimited popcorn then they stopped it all together. the prices are always changing.. its been doing that since maybe 2004.. once it was so high people stop going all together, so they lowered it. and once they started getting people try raised it, then people stop going gradually so they found a happy medium for like 5 years, i went recently and now its back to rising suddenly.. so thats a bit annoying... also i recommend  going during the day. i once passed at night(7pm-9pm i was at TGIF), it was filled with loitering teens and cops everywhere, so thats no fun.",-1
"We just had dinner at this Greek restaurant that is A 10 minute walk from the art museum. We were seated in the back room that was really cute and the waitress was nice. I ordered the lamb shrank with vegetables and my husband roasted lamb with vegetables and potatoes. The lamb shank was very good, the roasted lamb was good. The mixed vegetables was a gray mash of peas cabbage and carrots cooked to death and they were just warm not hot. They tasted OK but look terrible. The waitress said that was how the vegetables were prepared. The food seem to be just dump together on a plate and didn't look very appetizing. We also split a Greek salad which for some strange reason didn't have any greens but the cucumbers and tomatoes and olives were tasty. I will try this place again and order something different.",1
"So, I went back to El Arado on Monday with a group of six people. The staff seemed shocked about our 6 pm arrival, and ""sanitized"" a large table for us quickly. Yes, the table smelled like dirty sanitized rags, ugh, but, once you got buzzed on...I mean beyond, the smell, your waiter will appear and take your drink orders. 

We got beers and margaritas. The margarita drinker in the group declared that it ""was good.""  The prices for drinks weren't that bad.  ($2.95 for Mexican beers). 

We all ordered our food, which was brought out at a good time, fresh, and hot. Everyone snarfed - it was good and tasty and all our needs were met attentively by the quiet waiter. 

All of us were let satisfied, and our specific requests (i.e. ""no beans"" ""light on the cheese"") were met by the kitchen staff with no problems. We left with full bellies then went to the Red Garter for a mind-numbing strip club experience. 

What a way to wrap up a review..

El Arado has gotten a bad wrap - but, the staff is decent, the food wasn't too shabby and the drink prices are cheap. A good place to start out for affordable and filling eats before a night out in Fountain Square (or to strip clubs).",1
"I can't speak for the previous person's server but mine was pleasant....both to interact with and on the eyes (yes I am female) she was paitent with me as I gingerly gazed at the menu. She suggestes the combo since I couldn't shake the falafell calling but wanted some meat. Picked chicken and beef, and the beef was the winner. Falafell is a staple of middle eastern food and not all good places make good balls. THESE DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Crunchy and not over fried, I had a huge bowl of humus and baba to baste on. The tumeric in their homemade yogurt is so light and smooth it almost wants me to have another STL trip to come and eat a shwarma sandwich mid day!  Don't let the set back strip mall suprise you. Leave the inhabitions at the door wear elastic pants and get ready for dinner and a show. OBTW I passed on the hooka",1
"We just ate here for the first time last week.  It was a little confusing at first about how everything works but you quickly figure it out. We ordered the cobb salad. It tasted fresh and looked great. The order came out quickly and they were slammed at lunch.  They also have a ChargeItSpot where you can charge your cell phone for free while you eat, which I needed. A couple of negatives, the acoustics are bad in here. It was hard to hear them call your order and hear each other talk. It was a nice day so we sat outside. They need to label the plasticware holders. You can't tell if you're grabbing a knife, fork or spoon. Also the need an outside trash can. We had to go back inside during the crowed rush to throw our trash out.  Minor improvements that would make it that much better. Overall, it was great and will definitely go back.",1
"Food is typical Steak 'n Shake.. My issue here is with the service. Awful, awful, awful. Took my kids for breakfast and waited over 30 minutes for pancakes and eggs. Asked for salsa, ate entire breakfast before it showed up. Coffee refill?  Promised but never delivered. I don't expect McDonald's speed, but this is Steak 'n Shake, not a full service restaurant. Should be able to get in and out relatively quickly.",-1
"Yesterday, our breakfast experience was the low point of our stay in Montecito. The dismissive wait staff and the manager overseeing a nearly empty room who couldn't be bothered to refill a coffee cup so eclipsed the food that we will never return. The food was decent, but the ""service"" earned our server a $2 tip.",-1
"A year since first review and this place keeps drawing us back We bring all our friends and they come on their own too. Considering that we all live in Pennsylvania, it says something about quality, atmosphere and pricing. Yes it's noisy on Friday and Saturday, but not painfully so. Service is pleasant, efficient and accommodating. Food remains great. Chicken cacciatore, a dish I normally would not order, is fabulous here. Portions are large. Almost everyone leaves with a doggy bag and no one leaves hungry.",1
Just cut the cable cord and the huge expense that went with it. After reading others reviews on the time spent waiting to see a service rep to return Cox's equipment I was dreading going there. BUT (and the 5 stars is for this only) when I went to the Marrero store yesterday around 12pm there was no one there. Not one customer. Plenty of service reps though. I was helped immediately by a really nice rep and was in and out in under 5 minutes. Credit where credit is due!,1
"One of the worst places in Tucson!  Cold food , rude service. They have the right idea but fail to deliver",-1
Rudest bartenders I've encountered. Made us wait forever for drinks while they texted. Female bartender lost my husband's card when I tried to close out our tab and told me to calm down when I explained the green card she was holding wasn't ours. she insisted she did not have my husband's card at all and continued to speak to me like I was a moron. Never going back again!,-1
Found this place on yelp and came to try to since it was walking distance from circus circus.  Waitress was friendly and we were seated after a 10 min wait.  We ordered the popcorn chicken and pork cutlet bento.  Both were a little under seasoned for our taste.  The pork was also dry.  The peach tea was delicious.,1
"So I finally have a chance to try this place out after reading many many positive reviews on Yelp and on Facebook. For a Tuesday morning, we waited about 20-30 minutes (No line at 12 pm). There were 3 of us and we all were so excited since it's our first time here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Pancakes with a side of hash brown. One of my friends ordered the Rash Berry Pancakes , which he complained was way too sweet. The other ordered Pig in the Blanket (pancake wrapped around a sausage), which she ended up eating the sausages only. The pancakes were very average and plain, definitely not as good as what people said it to be. Hash-browns were average also. Personally, I prefer hash-browns at Bongo Java. The portions are huge and I recommend sharing it with someone. 

For that amount of waiting time and mediocre food, I wouldn't come back unless I'm around the area. Not worth waiting at all.

"Honestly, didn't live up to the hype. Food was definitely good but was not BBQ that blew me out of the water. And the corn bread was SOO DRY. Disappointing. Hoping it was just a bad night but seeing as I was visiting Nashville for the first time, I probably won't be going back when I visit again.",-1
"I was happy his was my first experience with Nola food and not my last, started on a low point. First, I understand it was Sunday night before Fat Tuesday and our waitress was working back to back 12 shifts. However, my drink order was forgotten, and my friends plate was mixed up. For my food, I had the po'boy shrimp and was underwhelmed, there was a hardy serving of shrimp but there was minimal lettuce or sauce and the fries were weak, many soggy. Needless to say, we didn't go back. From other reviews seems like we caught them on an off-day but unfortunately the result is a lack luster review.",-1
Omg you would think that the drinks would be strong so that you wouldn't notice how bad the food is but no such luck. Capirihinias taste like dishwater. Coconut shrimp were burned and the fried avocado was a gloppy mess. Never. Again.,-1
"This is the worst place to eat! I love barbecue and the pulled pork was so dry I had to drown it in barbecue sauce to try and eat it! The wings were so dry, the collard greens were so bland that I had to put buffalo sauce and salt to make them taste somewhat decent. The food came out slow and we were starving. It was edible, that's about it! Had to place a order to go at tarpon tavern because I was still hungry after eating what little I had!",-1
"Went to have lunch and place had nice ambiance and service was very good and friendly. Then came the food. They had several options. I had the pick three of sausage, brisket and ribs. The two sides were beans and greens. Out of the three meats the sausage was the least worse. All were dry and the sides did not have favors I would expect. I did not like anything. You even had to pay for bread.  I tried covering them up with the bbq sauces however even those were strange tasting. The sweet was pure molasses. The house was the only one I could tolerate.  I think they need to hire a cook that has tastebuds. We tried the apple crumble pie for desert and we even threw that away as it had no sweetness at all and no texture.  The price was crazy. Never again. Go to one of the many BBQ places in St. Louis that actually has good food.",-1
"The food - fantastic. Can't knock their burgers or fries, the topping selection, the taste or quality. Everything else? I've stopped going here. The people who work there are rude, indifferent, and sullen. I've had experienced where I've waited several minutes at the register for the cashiers to stop texting or checking Facebook before they ask me for my order. It takes forever to make your food. The quantity does not match the price (I swear every order of fries gets smaller and smaller). With the hundreds of other places, dozens of them within blocks of here, to get an equally, or arguably better, burger for less, faster, and with better service, the only reason to eat here is if you have no other options.",-1
The food was amazing but i never got everything in my order. I ordered the cheesesteak lunch special and it was suppose to come with a drink but i never received it. Cheesesteak was amazing and was cooked to perfection. The meatball parm is to die for. No other comments on the meatballs. The milkshakes i ordered they only brought me one when i ordered two but i still never got the other one. I would order from here again but afraid of not getting everything i paid for.,1
"Tried Olly Fresco's for the first time today. It's located on 107 Street, in the Alberta Health Services Seventh Street Plaza, ground floor of the South Tower. It's kind of like Sunterra in that it's mostly self serve, though there is a soup (4 different kinds) and sandwich/panini/breakfast counter at the back. Lots of choices for drinks (water, soda, kombucha, etc), snacks (like individually wrapped cheese, $0.85 a piece) and desserts (cookies, candies). A decent-sized salad bar with a variety of leafy greens (all looking fresh) and lots of toppings (chicken breast, deli meat, other vegetables). The hot food self-serve area also has about 10 choices ($1.89/100g) - several meats (today was roast beef au jus, roast chicken legs with mashed potatoes and gravy on the side, butter chicken, and another Indian dish), a fish (I think it was breaded), perogies (with self serve bacon and sour cream... dangerous), and some veggies (steamed broccoli and cauliflower, roasted potato wedges), and I assume there is always a vegetarian dish - today's was lasagna. I may have forgotten about a few other dishes. Everything is labelled and relatively fresh - I saw them replenishing lots of dishes even before it got down to the very end undesirable bits. 

I enjoyed the mishmash I picked up. You use take out styrofoam containers so you can always bring home leftovers. The lasagna was cheesy and flavourful, despite not having any meat in it. The noodles were not as al dente as I would have liked and it was a touch salty, but overall I liked it. The broccoli was perfectly steamed to retain nutrients - still bright green and just a touch of crunch. The roast chicken was really popular - I don't know if it was legs only but I snagged the last piece of thigh in a sea of drumsticks - skin was still kind of crispy and seasoned with some herbs (indistinguishable though). A touch dry but totally edible still. I loved the perogies - they were very generic potato ones, nothing special but not bad (e.g., the right amount of dough and filling, not mushy). I loved being able to choose as much sour cream and bacon bits (real ones!) as I wanted. 

There's quite a bit of seating and a lot of people seem to get the food to go, so I didn't have any trouble finding a spot for two around 12:15pm (it was busy though!). After grabbing a bottle of premium water, my total came to about $13, and I was certainly quite full. You can spend as much or as little as you want to. I thought the food was decent despite it being made for the masses, and I love the variety of choices - I understand that they change offerings daily so I'd be interested to try other options. I think it's a really great option for the people who work on this west end of downtown (note it's closed on weekends). I will be back!",1
"Spot on!

I got ""the veg"" and the spicy fries.  ""The veg"" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.

Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.

The atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar - I think that's the best way to describe it.  It's pretty small, so I wouldn't choose to ever eat in most likely.",-1
The food is good the service is terrible i went there about 3 times with my cousins and the people workin there were on the phones or talking to the other employees i didn't know if i should go and pour myself a refill or ask the waitress that was working at the time for a refill she took forever to come and check up on us and i would understand if it was busy but me and my family were the only ones in the restaurant and i think i understand know why were the only ones in that place i thought i came in to dine in not to get up and refill my drink myself if i wanted to get up and refill my own drink i would have went to McDonald's is this place a fast food place or a dine in restaurant and truly believe McDonald's has better service. Only thing that's holding me back from going there again is the service it's sad to say,-1
"I was on vacation last week and my wallet fell out in there. When I retraced my steps The bartender (younger girl) said ""I'm so happy you came back!"" My wallet was kept safe and nothing missing. I didn't catch her name but I am very grateful for her!!!!",1
"Yes, it's star spotting sensation and the pancakes and bacon are fabulous, but go without the kiddies.  
Your kids won't like the wait - heck, I'm a grown up and I don't like the wait - and once they get to their seats they will be treated to the oh-so-unspecial treat of having no booster seats but old boxes of sugar to sit on (??).  Can you say 'owner without children'? 
Alas, if you are going on a weekday early-ish, it's a darn good eatin' joint.  I've never had an order that was slow or anything less than what I expected.  It's worth the extra money - the wait is up to you to decide.",1
"I could write a lengthy review, persuasive and layered to hit all the right points. But why do that when Lee How Fook makes food that does it for you? Long story short they have some of the best general tso chicken I have eaten to date. Try it for yourself and get back at me. - Coolie",1
"I come here every so often. I like that its close to my apt and its on the water. 

Im here on some holidays. They have a huge buffet for them, so on big holidays I will feast out! 

Their food is good! Caesar salad amazing! Love their crabcakes! Great fish tacos! Yummy warm bread and soft butter. 

They are very pricey! Its an upscale type of restaurant so that is expected and it's on the water. However, I still come in my gym clothes and sit at the bar to eat, but honestly, I can careless about what I look like. I still pay the same price as everyone else. Still spend money! Plus I will stop in, eat at bar, and leave. So dont feel you have to be dressed up because its fine dinning. 

I give it 4 Stars because at Happy Hour time I will come in to eat food at Happy Hour prices. Well, the prices are cheaper on the crab-cakes but they are beyond small. They cut the portions way down with price too. I Still spent $40 when I just got salad, crab-cakes and 1 cocktail. And the serving sizes were small! 

Its also very different looking in there. Old and country like. I really dont know what else to call it. Just so you know, its not a hangout place at all. Just a dinner experience. Or they hold events there, think they are big for that. Its huge in there. Plenty of parking too! 

You should try them out, just as long as you go in knowing what to expect. 

Hope my review helps you!",1
"We have been here several times because it happens to be one of my sons favorite restaurants. However, I don't think we've ever had great service or good food :(. Environment is wonderful though, great for apps and drinking. I'm sure we will find ourselves here again when our son request it, but definitely not looking forward to it",1
"Maybe I'll write an updated review bc I really want to try it again but from hearing other people talk about this place, I wasn't that impressed. I got the creole strawberry which tasted like vanilla ice cream with some strawberries (which didn't even taste ""in season""). I should have tried some of their other flavors. Maybe next time.",-1
"It was... not good.  We got there late-ish on a Sunday, and the service was such that it was obvious nobody there cared.  Burgers were super dry and overcooked.  Fries were cold and soggy and too greasy, not to mention only half filled.  We've been wanting to try this place since moving here a year ago, and we will not be going back.",-1
"There's not much better than Valentine's. We've been coming for years, but it has been several since we've been. We went last night, and it was as satisfying of an experience as ever before. 
It would've been my parents' 33rd anniversary, so we ordered a honorary Bloody Mary for my dad's seat. 
Between the three of us dining, we had two sirloins and a ribeye. Mom and I upgraded our salads to include their housemade bleu cheese dressing. SO worth it. 
Each steak was cooked spot on. Everything was delicious. 
Mom got the caramel cheesecake for dessert. Holy cow! That was one of the best desserts I've ever had, hands down. 
The waitress knew it would've been my parents anniversary, and she brought out two small chocolate desserts that they do in honor of anniversaries. Not only was it delicious, it was the sweetest gesture I've experienced at a restaurant. 
I wish I could give more stars!",1
"It was only my first time here. It was an okay experience. The scallops I had were a bit more salty than I expected though. Otherwise, the deals are great. I happen to have come here on a Friday where they had $2-$3 specials on drinks. This used to be Mangroves, but now under this new ownership, the scene is a lot more casual and beachy than before. I liked it for its laid-back environment. They offer you free bacon at your table the way most restaurants offer free bread!",1
"Tonight I was really disappointed. I called and placed a take out our about 45-1hr prior to closing. I ordered a chicken Fajita and chicken enchiladas with chips and dip. The only thing right was the chips and dip, if you count that each chip was broke then maybe not. I should have taking pics of this mess I was given but I was to upset once I drove all the way home only to realize my order was WRONG and MISSING.. had no black beans and rice or sides for my enchiladas. You could barley see any cheese. I called immediately and spoke with the manager and was told that the enchiladas would been taken off my bill. No dinner than I hung up and opened the burrito I noticed I had no fajita peppers... none just rice beans and chicken..  I immediately called back. The manager agreed that the orders were wrong and she apologized and asked if I was close she would have the order remade, and take the entire order off my bill. Since I was feeding more than myself, I decided that I would return for the remade order so my teenager would eat tonight as planned. Well.. I drive 10 minutes back and get my remade order and another apology. The worse part about this is I should have cut my losses... but this is the same place that I hosted by friends Bridal shower in the private dining hall and the service was amazing, this is the same place that I have come for happy hours but tonight I should have said NO!! Get home and bam.. burrito smelled great looked great but NO Chicken.. NONE.. just beans, peppers, rice and cheese even tasted the cilantro but Where is the Chicken?? I didn't bother to call back this time. I'm gonna just cut my losses and not go back. Not a good feeling when you really want something tasty to get and get turned off Twice!! My nephew agrees.. he just went to Wendy's. Now I hope my refund is correct. Seems likely the next problem.",-1
"Fantastic breakfast spot.  I went on two occasions and varying degrees of service both times, but both times, the food was excellent.  The first time, the line was 10 deep, and growing mostly because the counter girl was slower than molasses to enter in a order.  It might have been because she kept screwing it up:

My rib eye steak and eggs some how turned into ham steak and eggs.... the hashbrowns are excellent here but when we went back on Sunday, they weren't serving hash browns, only grits.... I opted for biscuits and eggs which were fantastic as well...  Great breakfast to grease you up after a night of drinking or you just want a well grilled meal. 

Best practice, walk in to the back counter, order your meal and then grab a seat - no wait staff.  They offer up great bloody mary's for those in need a little hair of the dog.

I say some of the talent that walked in and out of here were better than the bar scene and much funner to talk to.  Unfortunately the busers take advantage of this also and the tables suffer with plenty of dirty dishes waiting to be taken care of... even when still when your food comes out... Go and enjoy.",1
"Excellent time here. Went late right before closing, 9:30, and the place was empty. The amazing waitress, Courtney ( I think ),  was very accommodating and even had the the cook take the heads off the shrimp at my request because it was slow. I really appreciated the hospitality here. Overall I would go again and get the boiling house sauce.",1
Visting from out of town and found this place on Yelp based on reviews. The reviews on the stuffed bell peppers was excellent so I went with that for lunch. I didn't care for it so I didn't eat it.  The kids had burgers and was satisfied. The handsome waiter was professional.,1
"RUDE RUDE RUDE, couldn't be bothered by myself or my friend and the small basic tattoo we wanted. Over priced the tattoo and and had the worst attitude ever. Big disappointment and let down for us. Dustin should get his head out of the clouds and come back down to earth with his holier than thou attitude",-1
"I can understand why this place has a bad rap because of past incidents but honestly if you go into it with an open mind and ready to dance you'll have a blast. The security guards were all very nice and efficient, getting in was super quick (we had a guest list). 
Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the coat check cost 4 bucks which to me is a little ridiculous. 
Over all i was really impressed with the service and atmosphere, and I'll definetly be returning (just without a jacket this time lol)",1
"The guy at the counter actually told me i made a good choice just going with mustard and pickle on my hot pastrami because it brings out the pastrami flavor... since thats what i wanted and dude agreed thats the right way... well... he knows a good pastrami as i do...

like this place...

my wife got a sandwich of some sorts that she was very happy with too... anytime im in that area needin a pastrami, thats where ill go",1
"I didn't want to risk having a dry burger, so I picked bison meat, specifically the Southern Caviar which also contains bacon, pimento cheese, stout onions, and a horseradish remoulade.  I didn't pick up on the onions or remoulade- the bacon and pimento cheese stood out as the heavyweight topping champions.  I have to admit, the bison burger was thick and cooked to a nice pink, medium. I could actually envision my bison roaming around happily in his humane pasture.  It wasn't very seasoned, but the salt from the bacon and tang of the cheese balanced it out. I also liked the hearty, seeded brioche bun. A side of spicy pickles instead of fries ensured that I could walk out without feeling gross in the stomach area. I ended up being way less upset that I spent $13 on a chain burger than I thought, in fact, I would recommend spending the money on a Bareburger burger.",1
"Good outdoor place right on Bourbon to listen to some jazz music in a casual setting.  We ordered their $5 drinks which were very watered down and put in tiny little plastic cups with some ice (Mint Julep, Sazerac, Brandy Milk).  We thought about ordering food, but saw what what other people were eating and decided to pass.  

One note, the table was really dirty, not sure if all outdoor places are like that in NOLA since Cafe Du Monde is like that too, but it kind of grosses me out",1
"Been here 4 times and every time the food is excellent. Without a doubt customer service is superb. My only complaint, and it's not even a complaint, is that I wish there was more tables to sit at. I hope that they will be around for a long time.",1
"OK. This is hard to rate because I have eaten at Rangoon and Banana Leaf (Same genre of food... kind of) and out of the three this is my least favorite mainly because the food was mediocre in flavor in comparison and the atmosphere just felt more like a production line versus a nice relaxed place where you can sit and enjoy yourself. It almost felt like they want you in and out in 30 minutes or less so that they can get the next customer in. Put it this way, if I didn't know about banana leaf and Rangoon I would probably rate this place a little higher but the beauty about competition is that you get rated amongst your peers and not in a vacuum. Good food but if you're looking for malaysion type food go to banana leaf.",1
"Had heard fantastic things about BFF and could not wait to try it. Needless to say, it completely exceeded my expectations. 

I'm by no means a picky eater but convenience is unfortunately the primary factor of most of my eating decisions, and BFF makes is easy to eat very healthy, very conveniently. 

I got four meals, two steak and two chicken fuel packs, and they have all been fantastic so far. 

Chelsea behind the counter was very helpful and informed me you get a free sauce with the purchase of a fuel pack. The meals also come in reusable food storage containers which is also a nice touch!

They will be seeing a ton of me in the future.",1
Omg!  The prices on this utterly mediocre (and I'm being generous on that) food are ridiculous!!  $17 for a kale salad with 5 over cooked shrimp??  Seriously?  $16 dollar burger no fries and a $3 up charge for a side salad???  If the food was amazing I'd gladly pay these prices but no way for what we got. Pizza had virtually no sauce and was tasteless.  Skip this place and go to Salt Rock instead.,-1
"Yay for Pizzarella.
First tried them when having a ""party"" at my house. The pizza was amazing. We ordered the thick sicilian style crust cut into squares. I got more compliments on this pizza than any of the other food I was serving. It was so good, we haven't ordered regular round pizza since, now all we order is the sicilian. It is also piping hot every time we get it. They must have hot coals in that bag!

Anyway last week we ordered it again along with a burger and some chicken fingers for the kiddies. When the delivery man showed up with all the food except the pizza, (he brought one slice instead of the whole pizza oddly) we were bummed for sure. The delivery man was so apologetic and said he would return asap with the pizza. About 25 minutes later he came back with the pizza, extra slices, and cookies for the kids. Above and beyond for an honest mistake. 
Love this place!",1
"I have visited Aldine twice: the first time, I mostly enjoyed the meal with the exception of slow service ... the second time, the experience was dampened by sassy service. First, in terms of food, I think most of the dishes are actually quite good. Some are creative (maybe a little too creative for some people's palettes), and the misses seemed to involve pasta both times. Second, the cocktails are also very good; I like that they make their own syrups and offer creative cocktails with quality ingredients. The food and the drinks make me want this restaurant to succeed, but I seriously don't understand what's going on with the servers, hence 2 stars knocked down. As I said, the first time I came here, service was slow, so dinner took somewhere between 3 and 4 hours (and it's not like we had a 7-8 course tasting menu), but it wasn't a big negative since I was enjoying my dinner company and there wasn't a hint of rudeness. The second time, the server seemed annoyed with our table, possibly because there was a vegan in the group who was a little nervous. Most places such as this one should be able to accommodate dietary restrictions without fuss (and it's not like we were in a David Chang establishment, where it's expressly advertised that no restrictions would be accommodated). Maybe having a vegan diner was annoying to the chef, although I doubt it, but the server gave enough sass and attitude (even strongly hinting at the number of plates we need to order) that we really were not feeling warm and friendly vibes dining there. Was he annoyed that there were only 3 or 4 other tables with patrons (on a Thursday night) and that his collective earnings from tips for the night were not going to be what he thought? Who knows, but if that keeps up I will find it difficult to recommend this place to friends ... a shame given the culinary talent in the kitchen.",-1
"If I could give zero stars I would.  Carside to go is an epic fail for this location.  Twice I have come here and after waiting twenty minutes had to go in and get my food.  Totally defeating the purpose of Carside to go... To top it off, get back in the car and they had screwed up the order and had to go back inside.  Don't want to sound lazy, but the whole purpose of that sales gimmick is so the customer doesn't have to go inside.  What if I were in my PJ'S...?",-1
"Thought that perhaps this would be an excellent place to go to get succulent Florida gulf seafood while watching the playful antics of tropical fish in their famed aquarium. Buzzzzzzz. Wrong. When we entered, we were shuffled over to a seat that was a mile away from the aquarium and told, ""Oh. There are many people with reservations expected."" Afterwards, an older couple asked the same question about being seated closer to the tank, and their wrinkly old butts were escorted front and center. Ageism at its finest! In the end, my wife and I and the old couple walked away with relatively the same experience though because the food was awful. Don't order fish. You will be treated to a large hunk of dry protein that has no taste and is topped with cranberries. Remember Thanksgiving at Grandma's house? Large overlooked dry as f turkey that you had to choke down with 8 glasses of Sprite? Bingo. Rumfish Grill. I called my grandma immediately afterward and told her that she needed to sue the place for stealing her turkey recipe. She was puzzled since we ordered fish. But y'all know what I'm talking about.",-1
"Warning: This location does not accept walk-ins. Signs are posted all over their front door saying ""absolutely no walk-ins"". My brother had a bad experience here getting fingerprints; employees were rude and bothered by having to do this service.",-1
"We have been here three times, and each time have had to send back a burger that was way overcooked.  The replacement burgers have all been good, but that means one person is done eating by the time the other person is not even started yet.  They claim to have the best burgers, but I guess not the best cooks.

The atmosphere is cool, the beer garden one of the best around.  I want to come back and have an experience that makes me give them a better rating.",1
"Think twice before renting from Event Rental -- they regularly and knowingly overcharge their customers. Make sure you know exactly what services are being performed, and pay close attention to your bill. Their business policy and practice is to fraudulently charge customers for work not performed whenever there are back to back events.

Long story relatively short: tents were rented three days in a row at a venue for three separate parties (one day for each party). Mine was the middle day (Saturday). I was charged almost $250 (a third of my total cost, which they make you pay upfront) for delivery and ""after-hours"" pickup (labor fees) for my Saturday event at a venue, even though I realized about a week after my event that the same tents were standing on both the day before (Friday day and through the night) and the day after (the tents stayed standing through Saturday night and through Sunday morning). So basically, they set up the tents on Friday, left them up through the weekend until sometime on Sunday, and then charged each of the three parties separately for the full cost of delivery/pickup labor. After many attempts to call and speak to a manager and never receiving a call back, I was told there was nothing they could do about it -- one employee even stated explicitly that it is the company's standard procedure to charge each separate client for the full price of delivery and pickup, even if only one delivery and one pickup each are performed for a weekend consisting of three different events. So after many days of no return calls and no communication from upper management or any admission of wrongdoing, I had to file a claim with my credit card company.

It's clearly a dishonest way of conducting business (""scam"" is the correct word), and when I confronted them about it in a respectful manner, they refused to admit any wrongdoing and ignored the issue until I got the credit card company involved.",-1
"I live closer to another restaurant but always find the food here exceptional. I had a large order, it was timely and hot. The lady and young man behind the counter were friendly . There are full orders. A large order is plenty for 4. We also enjoyed the sweet treats after dinner . Could not have asked for better. Well worth the drive.",1
"Delivered super fast but everything else sucked. The pizza and cheesy bread was not cooked all the way. They forgot my garlic and marinara dips. When I called, the dude that answered sounded high as hell. He said they were bringing my sauces back but no one ever showed.",-1
"Clean, professional and friendly.  Prices as expected.  I ended up here because every other place I went opens at 10.  They open at 930.  I was driving around since 9...They start to get busy around 10.  It seems everyone wants a pedicure!  I was there for a manicure.

Their techniques seem a little outdated.  I look at Pinterest for inspiration.  I'm not sure they could do those designs.  Like glitter for example, my former place had jars and jars of glitter.  It was all different kinds that they applied w a small fluffy brush.  But, the final work was acceptable.  

I'll keep looking for a design place but I would definitely come back here too.  Got a 90 second massage w manicure that was great too!",1
"Great service, intimate vibe for a date night, but I have to dock one star because our main dishes were disappointing and the dessert. There was nothing that stood out about the sea bass and risotto. The risotto dish was quite bland to be honest it was as if it were made for patients on a low sodium diet...so if you're on a low sodium diet, I recommend trying that! The amuse buche and mushroom bisque were delicious and the bread is tasty-they have a wide selection. The crab cake wasn't too exciting but not bad either, right in the middle. Another surprise was the flourless chocolate cake. You would think it would be light, airy, and not too sweet. Think again, I felt instant cavities forming because it was extremely sweet. With that said, not sure if we will be back, but I guess it is worth another try since so many people raven about the restaurant.",1
I went to El Camino on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. When I got there we had to wait for a table so me and my date grabbed drinks from the bar. We ordered a pitcher of margarita. The bartender came back to check on us and she couldn't hear me and flipped her head to the side and her hair landed in the pitcher. She said she was going to make another one. She pretended to throw out the liquid in the pitcher and make another one . Instead she walked over to the other bar and just added ice to the pitcher her hair landed in .That was strike one of the afternoon. Then when we were finally seated I ordered the pancho nachos with chicken. They brought it out without the chicken. I tell the waiter. Instead of bring out a fresh nacho they bring out the chicken in a bowl. Service is poor and the quality of goods is not great either. I used to like coming here but know I most likely won't be back again as the standards in customer service and quality of food and drinks has significantly decreased.,-1
"Don't like being a hater, but 1st knock on it 
was that it took an hour to get my food, then it wasn't that good either. Kind of bland.  The people are nice and the restaurant looks nice too, but doubtful if I'm coming back. The curry was bleh",-1
"This is my fourth visit.   It's much improved from our first visit but still not yummy.  The brisket, while not petrified, was still dry and chewy.  I'm not sure whether the bun was stale or just not to my liking.  It was kinda dry too but that might be the way its supposed to be.  I liked the mashed potato side.  Fairly garlicky.   Coleslaw too saucy for me but not bad. In general, I love brisket on a bun....but here it's .....passable.  Not something to make a point of coming out for.",-1
"Stayed at the Holiday Inn while on vacation, and thought we would give it a try this place is beautiful! Right on water, big and lots to see. Live music was great! I expected great food to come out and what I got was frozen seafood!!! Ordered the calamari- looked great but tasted like frozen fried with no season at all!! Kids got chicken fingers and a burger which also taste frozen and the burger no joke tasted just like a frozen bubba burger you get from the store. Also got the Mango Mai Mai, this I thought for sure would be good but again the fresh was rubbery, over cooked tasted frozen, the baked potato tasted to be old. When it came time to pay, i have my server a $100 bill she brings me back change for a $50! Not cool at all! In all honesty the only thing this place is good for is drinks. I'm very disappointed in it ! I should have saved the money and walked over to Crabby Bills!",-1
"Abysmal customer service. Came in on Wednesday at 6ish (not busy), ordered a meatball sub from some short white dude. He insisted that meatball subs only get three meatballs and when I challenged him and inquired as to why that was he got very rude very quickly. As my sub was in the oven I decided to look up subway's website and, lo and behold, meatball subs DO get four meatballs, just like every other time I have gotten a sub from that store. When I informed him of this and asked for another meatball he stomped over, smashed two more meatballs into my sandwich, and snippily finished the order even after I informed him I didn't want to cause any trouble.

There are some wonderful people who work at this Subway. That guy was not one of them and the experience was enough to put me off that store completely. I'm not expecting five star service from a Subway but when you try to take advantage of your customers and then get angry when they call you out on it, maybe you aren't meant for a job that involves customer interaction. Will not be returning to this store ever again.",-1
"The Star rate would have been 5 because the food ( sushi is delicious) but the rather iffy' treatment made me want to eat and go about my day quickly. We bought a deal through a third party promotion and unfortunately that was not fully honored, but when we asked for our free Edamane when you check in with Yelp they refused. We asked again if they can work the Yelp deal out and they did with an uncomfortable attitude. I'm not a destructive Yelper but It's my first and last time I'll eat at Ichiban. I do however wish them luck.",1
"I pass Citi Market almost every evening and stop in every week or so for a made to order wrap. I like both the veggie and non-veggie options, both tasty and reasonably priced. I don't buy many groceries here, but I usually pick up a few things that I need. The staff has always been friendly, which is another reason I like giving them my money.",1
"xochitl, the BAR you go to for ridicu-potent and tasty margaritas, some snackie things and a tequila-fueled  night of regret ... YES. 

xochitl, the RESTAURANT you go to for an impressively cooked meal that is worth the somewhat overpriced expense for mexican food ... NOT SO MUCH.  

they do serve some of the finest margaritas in the city. they are, as rumored, strong and should be consumed with caution. and the guac, though very high at $9, is incredible. each table has a guac card that you can use to customize the ingredients you'd like to add to your guac, including jalapenos, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, oaxaca, and so many other things. i only say that it's steep at $9 because you don't get much in quantity, but it's fair considering the cost of avocados. 

the food was quite the disappointment.  years ago (before the menu revamp), the food was incredible. i still remember one of the duck entrees i had there as being the best duck i have ever eaten. HOWEVER, the same cannot be said now.  

we had 2 people in our group order the $26 braised short rib. and they did not even finish it. the meat was dry and a bit bland -  totally tragic. 

the rest of our table had tacos - the carne asada, the carnitas and the fish. these were solid. honestly, there wasn't anything to complain about, but they weren't particularly memorable either. 

the tacos ranged from $13-16 and included 3 tacos. of the ones we tried, i'd say the fish tacos were my favorite. 

this is the upside though. considering the dearth of options fish taco lovers have in this city, if you're having a serious fish taco craving, xochitl is a reliable bet. the fish is not breaded/fried and it tastes very fresh, citrusy and the slaw gives it great crunch.",-1
"Went here after hoping on a plane. Quick lunch and had the Chicken Sandwich with fries. The bread on the sandwich was great. Chicken was normal but better than most. Atmosphere is a bit like a fast food place. Prices are slightly high so be aware of that. Other plates on the table were the Canelli' Special. They said the chicken was fantastic. They also liked the Yucca and rice. Would recommend if need a quick meal and the atmosphere is not an issue. Also, it's not a huge place.",1
"This restaurant is on point!!  My husband and I were at the entrance off the lobby just peeking in and one of the managers that was dropping something off stopped us and asked if we wanted to eat.  Only because of her friendly demeanor did we stop and eat.  Love love love this place.  Our waiter, unfortunately cannot remember his name...but he is darling, personable, and wore glasses and was by far the best waiter we have ever had.  The Bloody Mary bar was delish only outdone by the food!!!  OMG!!  Menu was so good and great selection.  The manager on duty came over to greet us and our service dog and told us more about the hotel.  So impressed that we switched our reservations for 2 weeks from Peppeemill to now to staying at Whitney Peaks!!  Keep up the great work and see you in 2 weeks!!!!",1
Food good but music so loud it's hard to hear you're friends talking. Also it's a bit of mayhem when you have to wait in line to order and pay. Cuban sandwich is delish.,1
"I've eaten here several times over the past few years and I have to say their service has gotten progressively better. When I first started frequenting this place (mainly ordering takeout) it used to take a VERY long time for my order to be ready. I would order and wait about 45 minutes before picking up and then when I would get there it would take an additional 30-45 minutes before the food was actually ready. So, I stopped going there even though the food was worth the wait. It gets old. I've tried quite a few things on the menu though I usually get the fried chicken platter with greens and potato salad, or the fried whiting with the same sides. I have tried other sides like string beans (too soft), cabbage (good), greens (good), and garlic mash (good). Their fish hoagie is really tasty and their turkey chops are as well. What I love about this place is that it is Black owned. I also love that their food is seasoned well and their portions are big enough to feed a small family. Tonight I ordered fried whiting platters for my fiancé and me and both had 6 pieces of fish with a heaping of sides. Their prices are good and I did not have to wait forever when I went to pick up my order. Nice job on the changes. I will def patronize again.",1
"This place is Smokey and insane...8 dollars for a drink at center bar , even if your playing the bar-top machines?? I know its not Vegas but come on, some tickets/vouchers I had from a month ago with money on the expired?? Why is that?? Even the stupid slots would not take em?? I had to go to meet a friend who spends a lot there, I was coughing my brains out from the smoke. I was stressed the whole time I was there,  as was my wife, it used to be fun, now it sucks.We eat at some of the restaurants weekly , but we are done. Now they want to re-do the lot and charge to park , what the hell is wrong with these greedy Indians or whoever is running this scam.Talk about driving people away, I know they don't care because its always packed house, the clientèle however has dropped to thugs and lowlifes. The parking garage is nasty like New Jersey...garbage all over,  stinks, gum on the ground, just shit. Now should I tell you what I really think??",-1
"Everytime I pass by here, which is practically once a day, I remember the meals we had for dinner.  Or, perhaps more accurately, I  remember that we didn't like Sunset 44 precisely because the dinner was so unmemorable--- so very, terribly bland. No flavor, no pizzaz, no zing. Absolutely nothing to bring us back.",-1
Great service. I don't think I even waited more than a minute or two each time to have my glass of water refilled. Oysters for happy hour were great. Our servers suggestion of the Crawfish Bisque was a good one.,1
"Was expecting a little cheaper given the ""$"" rating on yelp. In reality two sandwiches, one cheese fries, and two standard (small!) drinks came to $29.
Still the selection of sandwiches was very different to other places, tasted very good. Given the price point though we won't be coming back too often.",1
"Just ok. This restaurant was attached to our hotel. 

Bread pudding was burnt on top and all of the yummy sauce dripped off before it was served.

The ""bacon onion pizza"" (I cant pronounce the actual name, but we felt ""flamin cootchie"" was a possibility)was supposed to be awesome, but I felt the torte was soggy. 

The beet salad was great. Shrimp étouffée  had a good sauce, but small portion. 

As mentioned in other reviews, expect to spend some time there because the waitstaff is very nice, but slow.

All in all, there are better places to eat in NOLA.",1
"This restaurant has definitely seen better days.  Pricey, attitude, garish recent redecoration, terrible food.  Too bad, because for years it was a quality, friendly, well-managed place--best in Harahan.  Bring Rodney back!",-1
"I came here once & never again! The girls working know nothing about the food & basically shove a menu in your hand! I wasn't impressed with the food myself, it was very bland & pricey for 1 meal.",-1
"Do not take anything nice to this cleaner. I took in my nice Guess peacoat to be CLEANED, nothing else, and when I got it back the coat was still covered with lint, the fabric looked much older and worn from whatever harsh treatment she used on it, and she replaced the missing button (which I DID NOT ask her to do) with a gigantic ugly button that did not match the rest of the coat. Now I will have to take the coat somewhere else and see if they can fix whatever she did to the fabric, and I'll have to remove her 'new' button myself to replace it with one of the proper ones. Fifteen bucks down the toilet. I will never go there again.

Also, there is a $20 minimum to use a credit card.",-1
"Don't go on Sundays. I want to like this place but they won't let me. Tonight was the third time after two ""eh"" trips. The food is good. The presentation is very bad. The taste of the house margaritas is a selling point, however, you get 4 oz of ice and probably 3 oz of actual margarita if you're lucky. The service is not good. There is no accountability from management or servers. I was told ""It's not my fault, guys."" tonight (8/24/14) that I had to wait over an hour for food. I never received my refried beans and rice so that made it sting a little more to be overpaying for a mediocre experience.    

I wanted this place to open and be awesome but it seems like all they did was open. More classic dishes need to be added, prices need to be evaluated and customer service and staffing needs some serious attention. I may give it a shot after some time has passed when the kinks may be worked out. I have no intention of going back until I hear something different.  Even then it's going to be hard to drag me in there. Again, this is a bummer because I want to like this place and give them my money AND feel good about it.",-1
"I heard a number of good things about this place ,but I was very disappointed. Parking is terrible which isn't a huge deal but be prepared to spend a few minutes looking for a parking spot. We ordered 5 tacos total and it took about 30 minutes to get them. It seemed a little ridiculous for a few tacos, plus they weren't even hot. Slightly warm at best. Taste was ok, but wasn't anything special at all. Buffalo chicken wasn't great, the  Bbq and Korean were decent and the shrimp was mediocre. Overall, I gave it a shot and it wasn't worth the wait and effort parking so I don't see us going back.",-1
Changing this to a 1 after I just had to pay $10 to park. Seriously?   Not like they aren't making any money on anything else in there.....,-1
"Good place for a good breakfast and coffee. 
Simple wholesome and good service what else can one ask for breakfast?
If you are visiting New Orleans at the French quarter and looking for a good place to start your day, then that this is the place for you. 
Recommended...",1
"I haven't been this disappointed in a restaurant for a very long time. Ole Red's is a burger and beer joint. My burger came in undercooked and wasn't really very flavorful. My wife made the same statement, ""We waited for this??!"" I tried the Nashvillian burger and she had the Ole Red burger.  Neither is anything special. Service was extremely average for 4:30 on a Saturday without a big crowd.  I gave it 2 stars because the apps were good and it's a cool location. Go here if you want to say you've been to Blake Shelton's restaurant. His music is a lot better than his restaurants food.",-1
"Went for breakfast on Sunday morning around 10am; there was 4 of us. Wait was only 5 minutes, which was nice. Food was pretty good - I got the house omelette with homemade salsa, my side of bacon never came along with our waitress. She took our order and we did not see her again until we were done and waited for boxes for the kids food. Never got my coffee refilled because of that or any napkins. Service could have definitely been better - they're lucky the food was doable.",1
"- TIP:  Their black garlic wings are some of the best wings in the city.

- CON:  Recent happy hour addition was downright disappointing.  Quality of dishes wasn't up to Cheu's standard.  Service was curt.  

- BOTTOM LINE:  It pains me to give this place 3 stars.  A year ago, I emphetically would proclaim it to be my favorite restaurant in the city.  But they've lost their way.  Hand torn noodles are gone from the menu.  Service has been shoddy (it used to be extremely welcoming).  Food quality has been inconsistent.  It's a shame, because I want to keep on loving this place.",-1
I ordered the dragon phoenix it was my first time coming back to this place since 2008. I used to order from them almost everyday when I was pregnant. It only had 2 pieces of shrimp. I decied to give them one more try. the egg roll was good. The sauce was ok. but they do give you big piece of chicken. The one thing I do like ......... you can pick your own amount of sauces. They aren't cheap there .,1
"This was my first experience with Caviar's delivery service, who during what I thought was a busy time for Cheu (I walk by all the time, and it's always packed), delivered it in 22 minutes when the estimate was an hour. Crazy! The food wasn't bad, but I hope it's better when you eat in. One day I'll go back and eat in, but not any time soon.

I ordered the al pastor dumplings and the miso ramen.

Dumplings: You get five. They were a lot smaller than I imagined (like WAY smaller), but it's very interesting to basically put al pastor tacos (my favorite) into dumplings. They were really good, but way too small to be charging $6. 

Miso Ramen: They send the broth separate from the rest, wrapped in saran wrap to ensure no spills, which was cool. The noodles were a little stiff and stuck together, and there was hardly any meat. This is unacceptable for a whopping $14 (I've had a comparable bowl that was way better and had thrice as much meat as Cheu's for $9 in Chinatown). If this were $8, I would ignore the hard noodles stuck together in a ball and no meat, but for $5 more than the other guy who's better, Cheu is being held to a higher standard.

I expected more from Cheu after everything I heard about it. Even if they don't care about the quality of delivery orders and only put effort into eat in orders, this place is way too expensive for what you get. You could find better ramen for cheaper elsewhere.",-1
"Greatest place on earth?  Yes.  

I love this place.  I love diner food. Every time I go I get the country fried steak breakfast and I am never disappointed.  Very cheap for a ton of food.  And the staff is always super nice.  I really love this place.  It is open all night so it is never a bad time to go.  Everything on their menu is always available.  I love this place so much.  I just got back so now I am going to take a nap...",1
"I've gone here a few times and tried the regular and Kobe beef burgers. I would say it's better than five guys or Shake Shack in terms of meat quality, plus they have some interesting sauces....if they actually give them to you.

If you customize your own burger make sure you check that you got the toppings and sauce you wanted, A couple of times I came home with my burger only to find that I was missing those key ingredients that make the burger. At which point I was too lazy to put my pants back on and go outside, leaving me no choice but to begrudgingly eat said burger sauceless. 

I've gotten a different person every time I ordered, one thing they did have in common is that they had no idea what any of their own sauces or toppings were. If the staff had a little training and cared about getting your order right this place would be great. As it is, I think I'll save myself a dollar or two and go somewhere else for a quick bite.",-1
"I had been introduced to Bacchanal about 6 month earlier and loved it. I am happy to report that having gone last weekend it is even better than before, they now accept credit cards everywhere which is glorious!! Bacchanal has also become much more well known so you have to get there earlier if you want a table. There were 11 of us that went and we got there about 1:30 pm on a Saturday and had no trouble getting 2 tables. We proceeded to get wine and beer and go to town for about 5 hours. Around 3:00 pm all the tables were full and by 4:00 pm when the band started it was standing room only. The vibe of this place is fantastic, you are pretty much in paradise as far as I am concerned and I would have spent all night there too if everyone didn't want to go elsewhere. Bacchanal is awesome and you should go immediately if you are in the area and get away from all that tourist junk near Bourbon.",1
"Nice, relaxed atmosphere. There is a pretty fun concert space upstairs, a bar/restaurant area downstairs and an outside seating area. 

Unfortunately, the drinks here are TERRIBLE. I ordered a cucumber, basil, kiwi, vodka drink, but what I got was a glass of lukewarm vodka with a lifeless piece of cucumber floating in it. One of my friends had to ask for a new drink because hers was so overwhelmingly sweet. The bartenders are not very attentive, but our waitress was sweet and pretty accommodating. 

I wouldn't come back here - there are a lot of similar cocktail lounges and bars in Philadelphia that offer better drinks.",1
"I was disappointed for sure!  My mother and I went because we share a love for flowers and we hoped to buy some bulbs, flowers and get ideas for  planting.  Instead we learned about cookware, jewelry cleaner, beds (for sleeping not gardening), and many more gimmicks that ""travel the country doing this"".....Their words, not mine! Many of them didn't even have marketing material, just a promise for warranty.  I am giving this 2 stars because I was able to enjoy time with my Mom and did get one idea for landscaping otherwise it would be 1.  Unfortunately, I will not be attending this again and will be happy to spread my experience so no one else wastes an afternoon!",-1
"We have a vacation home in Tucson. Recently, the swimming pool and spa lights stopped working. . I found Cabana Boy Pool Works ad on the internet. I sent them an email and the next day got a phone call from Grant. I gave Grant my address because he stated he wanted to go out to look at the problem so he was able to give an accurate estimate. .Later that morning Grant called me. He said the cost of repairs would be $450.00. I told him he could do the job if he could do it for $450, maximum.
     One week later, I got an invoice for $615 with a note that he had made a mistake on the estimate. I feel that at a bare minimum , I should have received a phone call to advise me of the significant additional cost in excess of the quoted price  of repair. I phoned Grant but did not receive an adequate explanation for why he would not have at least phoned me prior to significantly exceeding the $450 in repairs that he estimated and I authorized as a maximum.
    I feel there are trust issues with this merchant. I will not use them again.",-1
"The food was amazing! BUT, the service was terrible. After we received our food, we didn't see our waitress until we were done. We were the only ones there and she was nowhere to be found. We wanted to order more drinks, but was unable to. When we received our check, she threw/slammed the pen on the table. She was very rude. I don't think it was anything we did because the only interaction we had with her was when we ordered and received our food. I don't expect people to kiss the ground I walk on, but if you work in service, provide that pleasant service; not an attitude. Needless to say, we will not be going back.",-1
"Unfortunately like every other store in this franchise this one is no different, lack luster customer service and an over priced and over packed store :/ They give you hardly anything for your items but I guess it beats trying to sell them yourself? I wish there was better competition out there but I guess this is what we've got in the area...",-1
"All of the salads looked exciting on the menu, but when further examined, it becomes evident that they all have the same ingredients.

They are way too expensive for such bad salads. The avocado in my salad was rotten, as were some pieces of lettuce, and instead of taking my salad back to the kitchen, the server just brought me some other pieces of avocado to throw in myself. Umm, no thanks. 

The dressings are all those really thick, extremely fattening bottled types. 

Our pasta dish was bland and uninspired as well. Try Longhorns across the parking lot, or even Wendy's for a better meal.",-1
"My family and friends came here last night for a little birthday party. The back restaurant was a tight squeeze, but made us all closer. The kids foods were huge portions compared to usual kids menu's. I got the Shrimp Fra Diablo, and as much as I don't want to say it, the food was uncomfortably spicy. A few people had a noodle or two to try and their lips, tongues and gums were on fire! I'm not sure if it's purposely that spicy or someone accidently spilled the chili oil into it. I took it home with me because for $19 I was NOT wasting it. I put some ricotta cheese in it (I did not have sour cream or lemon)and I still could barely eat it. Such a shame, it came out looking beautifully and the shrimp were huge and had the tail on (which I love, holds the flavor). The staff was quick and friendly. We will definitely be back, I just will not order the Shrimp Fra Diablo.",1
"Every meal, salad, chicken parm WONDERFUL! Dinner rolls hard and dried out. I love bread but the rest always perfect and the staff is always attentive and friendly but do something with those awful dinner rolls. Haha",1
"If you're a sushi connoisseur then this place is not for you. I, however absolutely love it. Sam's very strict on the procedures but that's what makes the shop so efficient and popular. It's in downtown so you have to find parking along the street. Sushi is sooooo cheap and I can basically get full spending $3. Drinks are available; limited seating and if it's too busy he'll just tell you so and expect you to either wait half an hour or leave. He's an awesome guy though. Go there, check it out, and enjoy!",1
"WOW!!!! This was our first time trying this pizza..............and our last!
Quick hint guys, pizza is supposed to have sauce on it, and this new thing we like to call CHEESE.  The pizza was undercooked, and cold when it arrived. Congrats guys, now I finally know why prison inmates riot over the food being served.",1
"Went here with my boyfriend and we loved it!
Old school feeling, with 3 floors!!

We have been here twice, and each time was great!
The food was amazing, I got the veal since it had been recommended to me, as well as the clams casino, mussles, pasta with oil and garlic, and the home-made garlic bread. Staff was nice and helpful!

...Went here again recently while in the area and had this new dish of gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce in it, and it was delicious!!!!! My new favorite dish as this place. 

MUST EAT!!!",1
"This is just some seriously authentic Mexican food.

I found out about this place from my boss who was raving about the horchata. They make it fresh. It's the kind of horchata that you have to keep stirring to keep it together. Definitely the best I've ever had.

The tacos are so well made. The meat is very tender and all the pickled veggies with fresh corn tortillas make for a wonderful, tasty combination.

You basically feel as though you are in Mexico here. From the outside to the inside it is very authentic. I didn't try the pico but it seems very unique.",1
"The room is adequate.  However the parking structure was completely full and there was no additional parking.  We called on the evening of arrival to ask for them to bring blankets for the fold out bed., and towels.  The NEVER came.  When we were
going out for the day. we called the front desk to ask that our room be tidied up, but when we returned the room had not been touched.  We also let the housekeeper in hallway know we were leaving the room for a while if she could please
make up the beds.  There was 1 bath towel in the room.  When I called for towels. was told they will be coming out of the dryer soon.   I would NOT recommend this hotel as there are several in the area and I'm quite sure you will receive better service at another hotel.",-1
"As good as it gets (in St. Louis)! (I've had better in larger cities, but I've been to most every other sushi place in STL and really liked Kampai.)

Me and two friends came here last night (on a Tuesday night) for the first time. The restaurant was mostly empty, maybe five tables filled at most throughout our time there. Service was attentive and helpful.

I had the chirashi ($20, great food, but too much for one person; get it and share), another friend had a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna roll ($15 total), and the third friend had a vegetarian roll and a veggie hand roll ($15 total). I also got the spicy tuna salad to go at the end of the meal. Most all rolls were under $10, with just a few at $11-14.

The spicy tuna hand roll looked divine to me, but it had ""too much"" raw spicy tuna for my friend. In other words, big pieces of spicy tuna, not just little pieces like you normally get in rolls. My other friend seemed completely happy with his vegetarian rolls.

The chirashi had a huge variety (one piece of each): salmon, smoked salmon, smoked albacore, raw albacore, ahi tuna, mackerel, shrimp, octopus, and probably some others that I'm forgetting. I also tried the uni (sea urchin), which was interesting, but I don't think the texture is for me.

Surprisingly (in comparison to other reviews), we didn't get any warm hand towels. I got both miso soup and ginger salad, whereas my friends just got miso soup (maybe the complementary items depend on what you buy?). I didn't pay too much attention to the menu, though. I did order hot tea, and they had to keep refilling my cup instead of just bringing me a pot, so I guess a pot would have been nice.

In general, I was pleasantly surprised by Kampai's variety and chef's tasting menu - neither of which I've seen at other sushi places. I'll be back and might even venture to try the most expensive ($80) chef's menu.

And there is FREE (yes, FREE!) PARKING for Kampai in the garage right next to it. Go in and turn to your left. On quick glance, I think there are 10 spots designated for Kampai. If those are full, I guess you're out of luck and have to park on the street. (We managed to snag a free spot, making the whole experience pain free.)

Delivery, take out, and catering, too - which I'll definitely keep in mind for the future!",-1
"A very sweet find on the main drag, State Street.  Heartfelt, accessible, and reasonably priced (say $20-30 per person total) Argentinian cuisine in a sumptuous but casual white-tablecloth courtyard dining setting.  I can't exactly describe what I had but it involved pork, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, creamy sauce, and it was fabulous.  Extra points for friendly but unpretentious staff and clean, luxurious bathrooms.  The owners also run a winery  back home and feature their wines here.  I would definitely return.",1
"Having worked in the industry locally for so long, I've never left a bad review on Yelp....until now.

Was in there tonight with my gf and her mom, because I wanted a low key place to enjoy a dirty martini. A dirty Tito's martini to be exact. Simple, right? Wrong. 

Out of olives.
Out of olive juice.

""Okay....just give me a Tito's and soda please.""

After the bartender searched the back for a while, she determined:

Out of Tito's. 

I settled for a Bud Light Draft. 

My gf ordered a Frozé.....Frozé machine was down.

She got a margarita on the rocks instead.

My gf's mom ordered her standard vodka and tonic, but after sipping it, realized the tonic was absolutely flat and became soda water. She got a Corona Light draft instead.

I reluctantly paid for the three drinks that none of us intended to get, and immediately wanted to leave. Before I left, I used the unisex bathroom with no lock on the door, and guess what? Out of soap. Good thing my gf was packing the hand sanitizer.

Step your game up Tamiami!!! (Bartender was apologetic)

PS- Out of bev naps as well. Substituted paper towels",1
"It's just one giant room. There's no flow-through for the meandering crowds. It's all just one big, long, irritating room. You're either being crushed in the front or bumped into by passing patrons in the back. 

Cheap, huge, strong drinks. Bigger than normal-sized shots. I got impossibly hammered here, but was frustrated with the layout.

I'll probably go back because they host good shows.",-1
"Absolutely amazing food! Everything is extremely fresh, homemade and majestic in the mouth. It's a bit pricey considering the portions and Ambiance but other than that... Amazing",1
I always leave so happily full and fully happy.  I love introducing people to Padero's Beach Grill.,1
"My friends and I tried this place a few days ago. The location was very easy to find and the place looked beautiful. Great place for a party. We decided to try the ""high tea"". We tried both tea options and the food was delicious. The table setting looked so pretty and we all had different style of plates. I'll definitely recommend this place for anything from bridal showers to birthday party's.",1
Had a wonderful experience with JT and Ashley Furniture store!! He was helpful even when I had to change my order.,1
"The ceviche was delicious.  The service was good. The pescardo macho had  no taste and the muscle where raw and gritty. When I brought it to our servers attention she said ""well everybody else likes it"". Not the answer we were looking for. Time to find another Peruvian restaurant.",-1
"This restaurant is 5 star food and service. We went here for a bachelorette party and they brought us complimentary champagne toast. Richie Rich was wonderfully nice and knew the perfect entrée for us by only a few clues to what we like. The food is French German influence so if you don't like that then this isn't the place for you. Finally, try the bread pudding! Amazing",1
Burger was OK.but not at all worth the price. I felt cramped sitting at the long table surrounded by people I did not know. Service was OK. If they brought the prices way down. it's a really expensive.mediocre burger. There are much much better places in St. Louis (both in terms of taste and value,-1
"Hilton properties are some of the oldest,  most dilapidated properties in the hotel business.  Additionally,  the customer service is the very worst overall with a few exceptions. 
Made a reservation here for 1 bedroom suite.  Suite wasn't ready.  Had a 12:30 lunch mtg  Needed to shower and change but suite booked wasn't ready.  What I thought was a courtesy extend turned out to be bait a D switch.  They gave e me a 'courtesy room' with the understanding that upon my return,  I would get the suite I booked. 
I  returned just to be to told that 'the room I booked had been sold.' Really,???? 
The suite was $250. The downside graded room was $235. I couldn't cancel the room and all of the rooms at a lower rate were 'sold out'  How is that possible so quickly? 
Fake apologies we're given,  but no satisfaction when more could have been done.   Never again.",-1
"I'm not really sure why I bother going to other restaurants. 

Every Valentine's Day I try to find some cute, new little BYO for me and my boyfriend to try out and I spend weeks scouring menus and Yelp reviews. 

Every year SOMETHING goes wrong and I get frustrated and pissed off and he always says ""Let's go to Jones"".

This year was no different. We went out last night (2/12/11...the weekend before Valentines Day) to the BYO I picked out and when I made our reservations, no mention was made that they had a special fixed menu that night consisting SOLELY of seafood, which I am allergic to. As I started to get upset at our table, my boyfriend said ""Let's go to Jones"".

We got there, were told there was a little bit of a wait, so we sat at the bar for a drink. About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.

We both got the filet, done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic. The mac and cheese is also an app we get every time and is one of my favorites. I got the deviled eggs for the first time and holy crap they were amazing. I'm gonna say, possibly the best ones I've ever had (sorry, Dad). 

Everything about this restaurant leans towards comfort and it's always done so well. The atmosphere, the staff, the decor, the food, hell even the temperature. I've never had a bad experience at Jones and I don't think I ever will. 

Next year....we'll just go straight to Jones.",1
"The Penang chicken with the chicken flavor infused white rice will always be one of my favorite meals. Wether in Boston or in Philly, the quality is the same and I am a huge fan. When we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15-20 minutes. The service was fast from start to finish so I didn't have to wait long before I could start eating the juicy amazing chicken. I was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to Virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so I didn't. I regretted that decision the second I got back home so next time, I will be greedy!",1
"First, I love that they offer food delivery! Second, THAT is a gyro! I got one delivered with fries, and actually I didn't need the fries! The gyro was so big I had to save half.  Both the fries and the gyro were very tasty. The tzaziki was spot on and the meat tender. I'll be back!",1
"We've been meaning to stop in, and tonight, we finally did. And glad we were!

There isnt much different to say that everyone hasnt already said, so I will just reiterate some of the reasons why Taste of Havana will become a regular spot for us. 

I had the Pan con Bistec, and my wife had the Cuban. We loved the bread (and everything between it). Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal, but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night, so alas, I dont have another meal. Guess I'll just have to go back! 

And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love. 

Try it out. Order a sandwich, have a seat, chat them up, and enjoy! I'm already looking forward to our next visit, and thinking about who else I want to bring with us.

Thank you for a wonderful evening!",1
"I was so disappointed when this opened; I was hoping for Nashville's first real authentic Greek restaurant (Athens notwithstanding).  This isn't Greek; it isn't even Mediterranean. It's pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto. 
Just say no.",-1
"This was my very 1st time in New Orleans. It's been an amazing experience and so far, every single place I've eaten at has been AMAZING. So... I took a chance with The Praline Connection and walked in. Why? The ambiance and the restaurant, overall, looked nice. 
However... I would NEVER return to this place again, nor would I Ever RECOMMEND it to Anyone. 

APPETIZERS:
I ordered the BBQ Oysters and..wow.. fucking wow...1st of all the oysters not in their shells. Instead they placed in a soup cup filled with  ""BBQ sauce"" that tasted like cheap Ketchup and Chef Boyarde! Disgusting! The oysters themselves were gooey.

The garlic bread was God awful! It tasted like stale frozen garlic bread. To make matters worse, when I received these appetizers, they were cold.. It tasted and looked like they had been microwaved and left out.  

I also ordered the Chicken wings. They were under cooked, cold and the sauce was nasty.  

The other members of our party ordered entrees. They all said, ""This Sucks!""

PROS: The service was great. The servers were all very polite and attentive. 
Restaurant was clean, nice tables, nice ambiance.",1
"We recently purchased a used car for my son, it was a 2006 and of course comes with no warranty because of the age, but I expected them to send it home with us in a safe condition. It was supposedly just inspected and had a brand new PA state inspection and oil change sticker from Conicelli. Needless to say we got it home and the next day the front left tire blew . It was completely dry rotted on the backside and the tire shop ended up replacing both front tires for $450. Money is one thing but after seeing how the tire just shredded we could have been killed on I95 on the way home. The tire just entirely fell apart. Never would recommend them now.",-1
"Too big, too expensive and too far from Downtown.  

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.",-1
"Hubby and I were eager to try this establishment due to a rave review from some close friends. We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left. It was very akward and unpleasant. If they were closed then the door should of been locked or a sign on the door stating private party or something. 
Not sure if we will attempt to try to dine there again.",-1
"Overpriced mediocrity.  Please don't waste your money here.  My family has eaten here twice and both times ""corporate"" has refunded the price of our meals because it has been so appalling.

This corporation/restaurant has no clue.  Please don't be ripped off.",-1
"I've used Merrigans several times for work on both a 2012 RV and a vintage 1984 Dolphin. They aren't the best at always answering the phones or calling back but they are the best at fixing what's wrong at a fair price. Your patience will be rewarded with a quality repair at a fair price. It's an honest mom and pop shop that has an eclectic collection of parts for older RV's along with the know-how and experience to fix anything. Definitely the place in Tucson where you won't get ripped off for work on your RV. If you want it done right and still have money left in your travel fund, go to Merrigans. They also have a FREE 24 hr. dump station WITH water.",1
"Stopped by to munch a burger during today's Seahawks/Saints game, and the place was, unsurprisingly, packed. For good reason, too: the Haven burger I ordered was fantastic.

I sat right next to the door, so I didn't get the chance to get more than six feet into the place; as soon as I got my meal, the place started getting busier and busier until I had to work my way through the World's Shortest People Maze to get out. Guess that means I wasn't the first person to hear about the place.

I will be going back to the Haven. Might go for, say lunch on a Tuesday, so it's less busy.",1
"was here twice -- first for a nightcap at the bar -- the drinks really were some good stuff and i tried a the lemon hummus and pita -- that was the best hummus ive ever had!

the next morning we came in for brunch, which was pretty much terrible. first of all, it took us 45 minutes to get our food for brunch....and it came out cold and we found a hair. the manager did comp our check though. overall, the bar is great, but i would skip breakfast. what a disappointment for a kimpton restaurant.",-1
"I visited Joe's on consecutive nights, one with a Living Social coupon.  The beef tacos on the appetizer menu were outstanding, and a great price which will ensure I order them every time I come.  Meatloaf and mashed potatoes were just as I expected; thankfully, no attempt to ""fancy them up""; just tasty comfort food.  I asked for French dressing and bleu cheese crumbles on my salad, and they were generous with the cheese.  The salad was cold and fresh and crisp.

The reason I did not give five stars was the service. The first night, we weren't told of specials (ugh, saw them on the way out and would have ordered them!), and my friend's appetizer order was wrong. Drinks were not refilled often enough, and the waitress seemed uninformed about some of the items.  The next night, different waitress. We were one of only two tables, and still waited too long for her to return. She was unable to answer a question about a menu item, as well.

The place is beautiful, and the bathroom was clean and bright.  The menu offers many thoughtfully composed choices. Some of your servers are not up to par.",-1
I had the carrot cake.... Very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder. It's too bad because everything looks so delicious :( also didn't like the chocolate chips in it either.,-1
"***Please note that if you lose something valuable you may not get it back. The person who may clean the vehicle may be a thief. I left in the car my radar detector complete with a case not logged in to their lost and found. When I check in my rental on 12/21 and returned 01/02/2018 to visit the counter they told me nothing was found. They also told me that for something with a case go missing was very unlikely. Yet they found nothing. Hmmm, I wonder how it can go missing when it was the only place I left it? I filed a lost ticket with them; Reference Number: 4355421, Reported: 12/21/2017.

They may think their employees may be honest but my $300 radar detector is nowhere to be found at their location. So? Yes, one of their employee's stole it. 

I'm a fan of the concept of picking your car. As someone who has been using the same rental place in St. Louis Airport for 8 months and counting. I can tell you they do lousy job at cleaning the cars. I'm always finding plastic bottles underneath the back seats.

I'm also finding a lot un-wiped of front seat and dashboard areas full of sticky substances. The cars are never fully clean as someone who rents from them weekly.

This location does a shitty job of making cars ready for travel. As someone who has access to the execute cars due to the amount of travel I do. They fail to meet some simple travel requirements you expect when you rent. 

Next time you rent look underneath the seats in the passenger areas and you may find plastic bottle under them.

I would love for them to review the cameras and see who cleaned the car so they can fire them on the day I returned the rental! I brought them thousand of dollars and I do expect a refund for the stolen item.",-1
"I will not return to this location. I contacted the manager in regards to a poorly made pizza I received, he replied to my online inquiry but never followed through on taking care of things. I even sent a photo to prove that the appearance of the pizza was not acceptable, and I never heard back from him.",-1
"Cashier was trying to put a beer on my to go order and I did not get the fish taco I ordered.

They have nice setting and the establishment seems to be fairly nice, it has got tvs, a bar, a number of tables in various sizes, and a downtown street patio complete with fire heaters for cold nights.

I had the sonoran dog and received two beef tacos that I did not ask for.  The tacos has scraps of beef with cilantro and onion.  They also have the regular styled tacos with tomatoes and lettuce.  The dog was the last one sitting the bin and a bit soggy.  Compared to truck dogs, it does not compare.  The tacos were simply bits of beef with onion and cilantro, nothing impressive and nothing like what is seen in the pictures.

Perhaps, my disappointing experience was due to how the place was packed, had a line out the door by the time I left, and was somewhat loud, but that is no excuse for the terrible eating experience.  They were starting to run out of the beef and dog that I ordered when I got in at the end of a fairly short line, i would hate to think how much worst if I came in a bit later for the dinner rush.",-1
"My first experience did mot go well due to the heavy accents of the employees. I called ahead so my order would be ready for me to pick up and it was, it just was not what I ordered. They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.

I was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce. It's looking like this place is a lot better than my first impression.",1
"Been to this location twice and will never go back again!!!!

First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I'm not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review.",-1
If you like onion rings order them here. Some of the best I have ever have. I also had a Reuben which was very good also.,1
"Great vegetarian and organic menu, friendly and helpful staff and delicious coffee! I'm definitely coming back",1
"Service was a bit slow for Saturday lunch but not unacceptable. Understandable as a new place gets its feet under it. I tried to go Friday night and it was a total mess. Long line and nobody taking names. We left. 

The margarita was great. I had the cilantro chicken enchiladas. Also great! The outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely Saturday afternoon. 

Overall, I liked it. They just need a bit more time to figure out the flow. I'm thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable and this place isn't trying to be ""casual fancy"" like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space.

Hope Loco thrives for years to come!",1
"Best service in town and best prices. Even the phone call just felt good. I called fast glass and they wanted to charge me 200$! About 80$ more than last time. So i looked around and found these guys. Called them and from the moment someone picked up i was treated wonderfully, they charged 165$ and it was worth the price too. I chip in my windshield spidered out and i was worried about a ticket, they fit me in that day. They vaccumed, wiped down the inside of my car and washed the windows. Waiting area is cozy and has tea, water and free suckers. They all treated me like a person, not a dumb girl like fast glass does. Ill definitely be going back.",1
"Great atmosphere, service was very friendly and prices were very reasonable however I found the food a bit bland, not bad just bland. My husband and I were starving after a long drive to Philly and this filled the spot but it wasn't overly enjoyable and we most likely won't be back.",-1
"Cinco de mayo means margaritas and sangria and all things fried... this great place does a nice job with combining flavors of several different ethnicities and backgrounds and develops recipes that are unique.  Although not touted as a ""Mexican"" destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!",1
"So worth the wait! The crepes are amazing! I also loved the grits, which is rare. Tried my hubby's pancakes....awesome!",1
"WOW!  What a fantastic place!  Food A+, Service A+++  We started with an appetizer of cheese curds served with a red pepper jelly.  LOVED IT!  I ordered the fish tacos and the wife ordered a beer brat for dinner.  We both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered!  The portions were huge and priced just right for the portion size.  Our server was on it!  Very attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us feel very welcomed.  The manager stopped by and asked how everything was.  I let him know that I am pretty sure I have found a cool new place to hang out, have a beer and watch football.  He said they have great deals on game days and let us know about their brunch on the weekends.  Everyone said goodbye as we walked out and reminded us to grab a rootbeer candy on our way out.  I will be back!",1
Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a delicious meal at a reasonable price. The shrimp and goat cheese crepes are a must have!,1
"I held my husband's surprise birthday party for about 35 people in the basement bar at Black Sheep. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the first call I placed to inquire about hosting the party and spoke with James, the owner, to the night of the party where Adam, our bartender, made sure all went smoothly, everyone I dealt with was fantastic. Overall, a great experience.",1
"If you are shopping for any kind of Italian food product, you need not bother going anywhere but Claudio's.  First, you must understand the culture--Claudio's is old school.  They are family.  There is a reason everyone lines up and tolerates standing in line.  The product is THAT good.  These folks know their cheeses.  They know their food.  If you have a question, they will bend over to help you.  Other customers will too!  I'm ""medigan"" as they say, American....ie  I am not Italian.  Hanging in Claudio's makes me want to be!!  Going to Claudio's isn't like running to the Acme for a box of pasta----this is an EXPERIENCE.  Everyone should have an experience!",1
"This place is awesome. A real throwback. Music is great, 4 stars (not 5) as they don't really offer seating beyond the first 15 ppl in line.",1

"My dad and I are on a cross country trip and one of our first stops was Saguaro National Park. 
We did a quick tour with Park Ranger Carolyn and loved it. She was incredibly enthusiastic and passionate about her studies on the saguaro and she was very knowledgeable. Definitely recommend both the tour and Carolyn.",1
"Overpriced and underwhelming.  Had the sausage/egg:cheese sandwich this morning on whole grain $4.89. Sausage was cold and the sandwich was about 1/2 the size of the picture on the menu. It comes on these large plates and it's just a embarrassing.  Husband had bacon/egg/cheese on brioche, $4.89 and his egg was cold and the entire sandwich was greasy.   I can get this kind of food at McDonalds for a fraction of the price.",-1
I love Bing's boba!!!!!!!!! The Taro snow is my go to drink. Definitely the best boba spot in Tucson! The place is always clean. They have board games for you to play. The staff is helpful and friendly. My husband ordered a drink that unfortunately was not at the right flavor level. He told the staff and they made him a new drink that was to his liking.,1
This was a nice spot with sidewalk lounge seating. Even had a DJ outside Friday night. There was a walk up bar outside too. The decor inside was pretty sweet. We tried a few appetizers and they were both good! It is located in a trendy waterfront area.,1
"An amazing view, impeccable professional service great fare,don't  skip a visit to this Philadelphia gem. Nick, who is a stellar, incredible server, recommended a lovely 2010 Bordeaux-Chateau Font Merlet which complemented the Tuna Tartare and Steak Tataki.

"I went here when if first opened, and have never desired to go back again, I was so very disappointed at the quality and the taste of the food. I would absolutely not recommend dining here.",-1
"Great Mexican BYOB! I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. 

I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... 

The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. 

I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  

The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!",1
"Awefull!!!! 
If I could give zero or negative stars I would!
I've never wrote a review before, but I am going out of my way to say that I had the absolute worst dining experience at the Sake House!! 
And esp families, stay clear! 
So first off, I decided to take my 15 month old son out on a sushi date. We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a ""to go"" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone's order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn't the issue. After 2 hours of waiting, and dealing with a fussy/hungry toddler as a single mother I feel like the least they could have done is offer a free drink, to say ""we understand we couldn't accommodate you, but we tried."" It's principal above all else. ...I just waisted 2 hours! And had to leave and take my baby somewhere else. Time is money! And I waisted 2 hours here! 
Time that is rare and I had to plan being a busy mother.
I should have listened to the other reviews about the shitty service here. 
Don't waste your time or money!!!
Stay away! Any other place is better than here!",-1
"I eat here at least once a month, and more often when possible.  The brisket tacos and brisket quesadillas are fantastic.  Happy hour starts at 3 if you're interested in a late lunch for 2-for-1 drinks.",1
"Nice Steakhouse in St. Louis. We went here for a client dinner and was pleasantly surprised. You get a nice view of the arch on the way in to the restaurant as well. 

The Apps were OK. We ended up getting the Carmine's trio (crab cakes, scallops and toasted ravioli). Crab cakes were above average. The scallops were a little saccharine for my tastes but the ravioli was good; and let's face it...one doesn't come to St. Louis for the scallops. Thankfully the filet mignon was exceptional. It was the perfect size, not too salty and rare just like I had requested. 

This was partnered with an above average wine list to make a great night out.",1
"Great dinner started with a wonderful fresh Caesar salad and bread followed by delicious cheese ravioli with pesto cream sauce. The pesto sauce was perfect, not overpowering the delicate pasta. I also enjoyed the Dunham cabernet. Delicious. Welcome to downtown, Richard's.",1
"Try the spinach and feta hummus, it is amazing. I had the chicken caesar pita and if was wonderful. The caesar dressing was very flavorful and the greens (romaine, mixed greens, etc) were good quality and flavorful (not your typical bagged junk). Pulling up the the place I was skeptical (they're in an old garage) but give it a try, well worth it.",1
"I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house.
The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it.
My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",1
"I was in so much pain from my accident, waited for 2 hours and was seen for 5 minutes and discharged with no medications to help me recover. If you are looking for a compassionate care, this is not the place to get it.",-1
I had the carrot cake.... Very disappointed tasted like licorice and baking soda cooking powder. It's too bad because everything looks so delicious :( also didn't like the chocolate chips in it either.,-1
"Sometimes I just head on over to Kingsway if I need a little shopping fix, instead of battling the crowds at West Ed. They've got lululemon, Jacob, Danier, Gap, Club Monaco, American Eagle, and a variety of other shops that work for me, and it's never so busy you have to brush past people in the halls. 

I sometimes just go for the food -they've got New York Fries, Orange Julius, Poppin' pop corn, Booster Juice, Extreme Pita, Bad Ass Jack's and other choices. 

The food court has a ton of seating. It's never completely full. There's a Zellers and a dollar store and a Sears. I just wish they had a Bay and a movie theatre to round it out a bit. Otherwise, Kingsway is as good a mall as I need.",1
"What a great addition to the Funk Zone!  Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.",1
"Seriously one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have had in a while. Smiley himself is a true gem and the food was DELICIOUS. Had so much that I am eating it for lunch again today - and I can't wait! Please recommend to everyone you know in Manayunk, don't want to lose this place!",1
"I LOVE Weaver's Way and really disagree with some of the content in previous reviews. WW is not necessarily meant for convenience shopping. I am a single woman and I find that I have no trouble shopping at the co-op, during peak times or otherwise. I actually find the co-op to be a great place to shop if you live alone because I can get smaller quantities of items than if I shop at the corporate stores like Acme. I also enjoy the work hours - I've worked throughout the store, but most recently, I have been getting in my hours by participating in the membership committee. I wouldn't say that the community is necessarily made up of ""tree huggers"" and ""earth children"", though. The community is made up of a variety of similarly-minded folks from different backgrounds. I enjoy having a place to go to where I can obtain locally grown produce, a place that offers more natural, wholesome, and preservative-free foods than chain stores with prices way below that of Whole Foods. I enjoy interacting with other members and contributing to my local and global community. I don't find the membership fee or the work hours to be prohibitive being a single person vs. a family. I don't think that membership in a co-op is for everyone and, if you aren't single, it's definitely not a solo decision. If you're keen on being committed to the Weaver Way values, you couldn't find a better place to shop. If not, stick to the chain stores or just pay the 10% visitors' fee to pop in once in a while.",1
Melissa is by far the BEST! I've gone to two other lash lounges and I will tell you Melissa outdoes them all. She knows her craft. She doesn't double or triple stack lashes. She gets you in and out. 100% recommend going to Melissa.,1
"I held my husband's surprise birthday party for about 35 people in the basement bar at Black Sheep. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the first call I placed to inquire about hosting the party and spoke with James, the owner, to the night of the party where Adam, our bartender, made sure all went smoothly, everyone I dealt with was fantastic. Overall, a great experience.",1
"Worst nail salon experience ever. The guy said ""what is wrong with you"" to a customer who accidentally chipped her nail. When I was explaining how I wanted my nails filed he told me to do it myself. Really bad job. Everyone was rude and does the job too quickly. You would think after having such bad reviews they would learn..",-1
"Would it be weird if I wanted to move in and permanently live here!? The style of this salon is impeccable. The color palette and decor they chose makes it feel like you're in a Restoration Hardware magazine...in France...surrounded by heirloom antiques. I didn't know what to expect when arriving but I was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like Chanel and many others I actually didn't know I needed in my life until I arrived. 
Service was prompt and I especially enjoyed the extended massage. Most importantly the tools she used were brand new/ had been sterilized. I watched her open the fresh package up, that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety. I don't know if all nail salons have cute gold tips on their nail trimmer tools but now I want them for my own collection. 

I picked a gray color for my toes and did OPI Funny Bunny gel on my nails. So far I'm loving both! 
So nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to Nashville. I've gone to others in Nashville that seem to be high end, but it just ends up like a VIP club on the Vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a Justin Bieber song to come on. 
CURED was not only high end, but it was classic. Like The Hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe. I think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities. I felt comfortable with their prices, competitive to anywhere else I've gone in Nashville worth mentioning. 

I didn't know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot. Looks like there's a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction. So I'm assuming once those are complete, parking will be pretty straight forward? 

When my Mom & Sister come into town next I'm going to take them here & go to Local Honey for lunch since it's so close. 

Can't wait to go back. Welcome to the neighborhood!",1
"Beautiful clean shop with knock your socks off Everything ...
Homemade breakfast tarts and chicken pot pies .
All sweets looked well beyond beautiful and delish.
I felt some of the items were a tad pricey considering the sizes being on a smaller size. But I know premium quality costs more .. 
It's a great place for locals and worth a trip if traveling from center city etc .
I found counter staff to be most friendly and engaging 
Will be back and certainly will recommend",1
"We arrived at Happy Hour, 50 cent oysters and half price drinks, so we had both, the ordered the beet salad (divine), mussels, and flammenkuchen (an appetizer I used for my entree),  All were excellent.  I first had flammenkuchen (or tarte flambe) in Strasbourg at a street fair, this was far and above that experience, with caramelized onions resting atop the cheese and hunks of bacon strewn around.  So good!",1
"Can't tell you how happy I was to see see Heather finally open a shop...I've followed her as a client for years. She is a color wizard, a genius at crafting a look with flair just for you, and can make a tasteful and creative suggestion if you're stumped, or roll with your personal vision. On top of that, Heather has created a shop vibe that is unstuffy, chill, and totally comfortable. I trust her and the staff she hires when I recommend friends and family, and love that she's made a home in the heart of E. Passyunk. Ask her for tips on caring for cactus houseplants, or chat about vintage bikes when you visit.",1
"Best service in town and best prices. Even the phone call just felt good. I called fast glass and they wanted to charge me 200$! About 80$ more than last time. So i looked around and found these guys. Called them and from the moment someone picked up i was treated wonderfully, they charged 165$ and it was worth the price too. I chip in my windshield spidered out and i was worried about a ticket, they fit me in that day. They vaccumed, wiped down the inside of my car and washed the windows. Waiting area is cozy and has tea, water and free suckers. They all treated me like a person, not a dumb girl like fast glass does. Ill definitely be going back.",1
Best thai food in the area.  Everything was authentic and delicious.  Will definitely be back again and again.,1
Awesome service and food.  Served with a dry ice fog thing that add a layer of coolness to the whole experience.,1
"I went to my first BarreAmped class at the Music Row location (I've also been to bounce class - on a trampoline - at the Nations location), and it was a great class: definitely a better workout and a better experience than some of the barre classes I've taken in town since moving to Nashville in July. Had a very family vibe - everyone knew each other in my class except for me (a Class Pass-er trying it out for the first time). Great instructor - very hands on. 

The room is TINY, but luckily there were only six or seven of us in the class (it was a random class in the middle of the day on a weekday). The room is oddly shaped and very small, so if the class was full, I'm sure I would have been hitting everyone else with my arms and legs every 30 seconds. Another frustrating thing? BarreAmped is located within a house on 16th that is also a gym. The building does not say BarreAmped on it! No sign at all! It was my first time coming to this location, and I drove right past it and had to circle around to find it. Then, when I walked inside, no one was at the welcome desk, so I wasn't even sure I was in the right building! Finally someone came in (looked like something using the gym rather than working there), and she told me the BarreAmped room was the up the stairs. A bit confusing. I wish that information had been on Class Pass and that they had a sign on the building.

Still it was a great class, and I think I'd go again!",1
"I ate at Puckett's yesterday for lunch, and I have to say it was some mighty tasty food for an old-fashioned meat-and-three.  But I actually had a meat-and-two!  Definitely check out the squash casserole.  it was quite the tasty dish.  I'd also recommend their meatloaf, which is what I had.

My only complaint--and it's a minor one--is that they advertise cornbread.  Yes, it's cornbread, but not a slice of cornbread like you typically think of it.  People in the North would call it a corn fritter.  Being from KY, I'd call it a hoe cake.  It's cornbread but more like a cornbread pancake.",1
"Hilton properties are some of the oldest,  most dilapidated properties in the hotel business.  Additionally,  the customer service is the very worst overall with a few exceptions. 
Made a reservation here for 1 bedroom suite.  Suite wasn't ready.  Had a 12:30 lunch mtg  Needed to shower and change but suite booked wasn't ready.  What I thought was a courtesy extend turned out to be bait a D switch.  They gave e me a 'courtesy room' with the understanding that upon my return,  I would get the suite I booked. 
I  returned just to be to told that 'the room I booked had been sold.' Really,???? 
The suite was $250. The downside graded room was $235. I couldn't cancel the room and all of the rooms at a lower rate were 'sold out'  How is that possible so quickly? 
Fake apologies we're given,  but no satisfaction when more could have been done.   Never again.",-1
"I definitely won't be coming back here. Long story short, I scheduled an appointment online to have the transmission and differential fluid changed on my pilot. I arrived on time, and I was told it would take approximately 2 hours for completion, I also said I wanted an oil change, but "" full synthetic"". He said it would be $20 more, I said okay. When it was finally done and I was ready to check out, my advisor (Brandon) give me the total cost, which was double than what I expected and paid for in the past. I asked him what was all done, he said, ""they completed a transmission flush instead of the regular drain and refill"". I told him that's not what I wanted or asked for. He went on to say ""it was good for the car and whatever"", like I'm some kind of idiot. First of all Honda doesn't recommend doing a transmission flush and secondly, its almost triple what you would normally pay for a standard transmission fluid change. On top of that they didn't even do a full synthetic oil change it was just a blend. I didn't have time to argue with him because I was already late for an appointment, but I have the email showing what I originally asked for, so I'll be calling my bank soon.",-1
"Pretty average take-out chinese. Not bad, not the best, but id definitely eat there again. ***update--- just ate there again and they got our complex delivery perfect and the food was excellent! 5 stars now!!",1
Found 51st Deli on Uber Eats and we loved it!!! I can't wait to check it out in person!,1
"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Salty's this evening.  As first time customers, it will be on our list of places to return when we make it back to town.  

They have a good kids menu, enough to keep the little ones content with options like burgers, Alfredo pasta, chicken, shrimp, quesadilla, etc.  

We started with the Crabby Dip which the whole family enjoyed but feel it was a little overpriced at $14.  For the main course I enjoyed a Salty Burger while she had the macadamia crusted grouper, both were excellent choices!  Service was spot on making this a five star experience for us!",1
"im going to have to give this place one star for its horrible customer service:

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, ""it says it right on the sign,"" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut",-1
"Our wedding at Winters Creek Lodge was absolutely fantastic. Judit was a rockstar. She got us organized, and was very flexible and helpful to allow us to fulfill our vision. Our guests have raved and raved about the views and what an amazing venue it was. Our photos are breath-taking. Regarding the food, you will hear that they do not offer tastings, but do not worry: we can confirm that it was absolutely delicious. Their pricing is also very competitive for the area.

We strongly recommend working with Judit at the Winters Creek Lodge.",1
"Wow! What a workout you get in 20 minutes. 
I didnt believe it until I tried it. Now I'm hooked and feeling better than I have in a long time!!!
Ask for Chelsey. She is great to work with!!!",1
"I love Mr. Wizard's because they offer frozen yogurt which is a  lot healthier than frozen custard. I like that they offer some pre-select combinations or you can create your own. The only part that sucks is that there is only outside seating so if it's cold outside, plan to eat in your car.",1
I have been a fan of Chateau La Vin for a few years. It has been fun to watch the place evolve. At first it was more of a wine store with only a few tables. Now it has been transformed into a wine bar. He offers cheese and crackers and people order from the local restaurants and some of them even deliver. He had two guys playing music. He offers so many different wines and is willing to share his knowledge. My friend is a beer drinker and he has a nice variety for them as well. He does have a few tables out in front. This is a great place.....,1
"We had an excellent lunch here. The food was great and the service was fantastic. Great Gumbo Ya Ya, great BBQ shrimp, delicious crab cakes. Everything we tried was good. I highly recommend this place.",1
"First impression:

Home Wine Kitchen's ""No Menu Monday"" is a must-try for anyone interested in the St. Louis fine dining scene or good food more generally.  We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you'll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That's a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.

As starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and ""love sauce.""  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner's palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I've tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.

The staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.

By the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.  Leaving the restaurant, I was glad that I had tried No Menu Monday, but did wonder what the meal would have been like had I ordered off the menu.  I guess that calls for a return visit, don't you?",1
Best place for salads! I go there every time I'm in town for lunch. It's fast and veggies are always fresh.,1
"The decor of this restaurant is pretty modern.  It seems great for people in their 20s.  I had the mahi mahi with pita chips and hummus.  It was really good.  The fish was tender and flavorful.  The service was good, too.",1
"I LOVE JONES. Honestly.....

I was introduced to Jones at the YEE earlier this year. The food was divine. Comfort food to the max. Mac and Cheese that I could've eaten with a ladle, sliders, pigs in a blanket, delicious cocktails. Yum yum gimme some.

We came back with my mother and fell in love again. The calamari is the best calamari I've had in quite some time. Perfectly crisp, not rubbery, full of flavor. Yum.

For dessert? I had the Duncan Hines slice of yellow cake and glass of milk. Genius.

We came back AGAIN a few weeks ago when a friend was visiting from LA. I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The husband had the Halibut. Our friend had the Roast Beef Dinner. Our friend won when it came to food selection. My belly was so warm and happy after one bite of his roast beef. The meat was succulent, juicy, the perfect medium rare. The mashed taters were creamy with a slight hint of garlic. Mmmm.

I preferred my husband's halibut over my tuna. The tuna was good, but the halibut had more flavor, IMO.

Can't wait to go back again. Yum yum yum.",1
"My husband and I go here often and we have yet to have a bad meal.  Love this place! Wonderful service, wonderful food, wonderful everything! Worth your time!!",1
"Came here tired of going to buffets and other buffets like locations. This was a few minutes walk from the Peppermill too.

The place was next to a few auto repair places and most likely are patronized by them. The food is but a low-quality Chinese food. They couldn't get our orders right the 1st time around and the 2nd time ordered a simple dish that tasted completely nasty.",-1
"You will have to stand in line, you will have to squeeze onto a wooden bench with a lot of strangers, you will not have heat or a/c and .... it is worth it.  This is such a fun jazz show and such a cool space - you have to try it at least once and I am betting that if you go once, you will go again.  This place is legendary!",1
"It is what you expect in an Acme, the only thing I found a little different with this one is that it seemed the aisles were a little narrower than in other stores. Store is a little smaller than others so not as wide of a variety, but was fine, looks like they've upgraded some areas like the frozen/refrigerated food sections. Service was fine.",1
"This place gets two stars from me only because the gravy fries were good. Their sandwiches are awful. Thick slabs of badly sliced, tough, dry meat....gross. I made the mistake of ordering their pork sandwich once and it was inedible. I tried to bite into the sandwich and couldn't even bite through because of how tough and rubbery the pork was. I don't understand why they slice the meat the way they do but it makes for a disgusting sandwich. The people raving on how good this place is are just locals who have never had anything better. You're better off going to Wawa for a sandwich. Seriously. It will at least be edible.",1
Great service. My husband ordered a cheese and bacon burger and I got the crawfish sausage por bo both well made and great tasting.,1
"This is an updated review. I've been ordering from silver mine's at the same location for the last 4-5 years and they have only gotten progressively worse. Don't ask for anything to be added to your soup or chili; they'll charge you for the additions but will not include them in the order. They'll also most likely to include the free side such as the bread. It literally takes at least an hour to get your food delivered, maybe they should call Jimmy Johns and ask the what their secret is. This business is in major trouble with all of the other options available. The service is worse than if you had a bunch of kindergarteners running the business, at least they would be nice. You guys are right next to Eller Business School, why don't you ask them how you can improve??? Currently, this place is an embarrassment to their industry, and a waste of space on University Blvd. NEVER ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.",-1
"Best auto body shop in Philadelphia in my opinion. My Honda Fit had accumulated all sorts of nicks, dents, scratches, and even some really ugly lime deposit stains on the hood of my car. I took it to Devlin's to get touched up, and what I got back was a car that looked like it just rolled off the assembly line. Honestly, if I told you my car was 3 years old and had gone through a few scrape-ups, I don't think you'd be able to tell. Ed Devlin is a miracle worker, and he does his magic at a super affordable price... I was shocked at how inexpensive the bill came out to be.",1
"We're new to the area, so we're exploring restaurants every weekend. My wife has already proclaimed The Roost her favorite, and that's based on many years of breakfast dining, not just in this area. They bake all their own breads and pastries. Try the raisin bread or sugar-cinnamon toast. Yum! The cornbread casserole is another dish my wife and I highly recommend. And the service was prompt, attentive and very friendly. Enjoy!",1
"It was great. The your was interesting if you're in to tours. The beer was good. The atmosphere was the best part. A couple of Tvs for sports, board games, live music, and yours every hours. At times it seems like there's a lot going on but it flowed well. Great spot for a good time with friends or a date.",1
"We arrived at Happy Hour, 50 cent oysters and half price drinks, so we had both, the ordered the beet salad (divine), mussels, and flammenkuchen (an appetizer I used for my entree),  All were excellent.

"We had such a great meal at Spiro's tonight! Neither my dining companion, nor myself had been there previously. We both had a Greek salad, which was prepared table side. I had the Dolmades, and my coworker, the combo plate which had moussaka and dolmas and lamb (which he could not stop raving about). To our surprise our server brought dessert on the house, since we had never dined there before, it was such a nice touch! Ben our server was fantastic and knowledgable. We are both in the industry so we felt guilty about staying until the restaurant closed, but we were just so comfortable and well fed that we lost track of time. Spiro's is very close to my house, it will definitely be my new regular spot. Thank you Ben, and the whole Spiro's crew, for a great time to compliment a rare night off! You rock!",1
Great family restaurant feel. Po boys had the perfect bread. We had 3 different kinds and all were tasty. Mac 'n Cheese was good and a little spicy. Really fabulous service.,1
"Decent frozen yogurt with a lot of options for toppings. They have about 8 different froyo flavors to chose from. Lots of possible combinations. However, it can get expensive pretty quickly when you weigh the cup. 

There's not a lot of seating inside. Staff is friendly but not very active. I do want to try their bubble tea, but j wasn't very impressed.",1
"For a $16 haircut, I was expecting an OK-looking trim (all I really needed was some damage control - just someone to lop off my split ends and maybe add a few layers).  What I got was a very professionally looking haircut that works well with my face shape and made my hair a lot healthier and happier.  My expectations were far exceeded - and it definitely surpassed my last 'professional' hair salon experience.  Plus, the shampoo smelled amazing and the girl was really thorough.  I wish I had brought more cash to tip her!!!  The only thing you should keep in mind before going is time.  I had to wait an extra half an hour and it was the longest haircut I've ever had.  I would much rather have the student take the time to make sure it looks good, however, than have someone do a half-ass job.  I think it's important that the school has a series of steps and checklists their students have to go through to ensure they are giving you the best experience possible.  Just make sure you have a decent block of time in your schedule to relax in the chair!",1
"Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it. 

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",1
"I like it. The atmosphere is festive and there is a nice variety of music in Spanish. Service is attentive and they got my picky order straight.

It was a boring salad made with iceberg lettuce that could easily be improved by using romaine or something darker. My more culinary friend ordered the chicken soup and swears it is one of the best he has tasted. And this guy knows food. He is the type of person that has a hog slaughtered and knows what to do with the meat.

So it's a great place to go for chicken soup, and I heard the queso fundido is pretty darn good as well. Although it was recommended you order just the queso, and if you want chorizo, ask for it on the side because otherwise it gets a little greasy.",1
"great food, great view. Try the lobster mac and cheese",1
"Spot on!

I got ""the veg"" and the spicy fries.  ""The veg"" is a portabella burger, with grilled mozzarella, picked veg, arugula, and gauc.  Wholly non-cow is this thing spectacular for a bella burger!  The bella is on bottom, then the mozzarella is directly fused on top of that.  I actually thought the cheese was halloumi at first because it wasn't super melted (a good thing). The gauc and pickled veg are slightly citrusy and vinegary, but are contrasted by the bitterness of the arugula.  There's a nice bun to contents ratio, and for bonus points it's a potato bun.

Wasn't sure what to expect with the spicy fries going in - are they hot sauce fries, etc?  Turns out they are of the crab-fries variety with some subtle other spices added in.  Nice portion - not too big.

The atmosphere kind of reminds me of a dive bar - I think that's the best way to describe it.  It's pretty small, so I wouldn't choose to ever eat in most likely.",-1
This is the place we have been searching for! My friend and I have tried several nail salons in Tampa and nobody could do designs and stuff like how we wanted so we found this place on Instagram and we will never go anywhere else again! We drive almost an hour to get here but it is so worth it! I have had 2 different people who both did exactly what I wanted and are extremely talented! Thank you Pamela and Steven! You all do amazing work!!!,1
"I'm so happy we came upon this place randomly. They have a happy hour 3-8pm everyday:  Half off all beers, $3-$4 glasses of wine & $8 hookah! Their hookah on non-happy hour is $13. They have a wide selection of shisha flavors and even options of an ice chamber or smoking from a fruit bowl (extra charge). They do have a food menu, but I didn't try anything from it. But the plates I saw coming from the kitchen look pretty good. Overall, a really chill place to come and relax with friends. It was definitely an enjoyable experience.",1
"I finally made it to Farmhaus last Saturday, and it was worth the wait.  

As expected for a weekend, it was crowded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  

The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....

Service was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.  

I would love to go back and check out their blue place special lunches...I have heard amazing reviews.  I think I will head back for dinner when there is outdoor seating, as I think that would add to the experience.",1
Sometimes this food is very very good.  Unfortunately it's not consistent.   Ordered something I've been getting for years and every other time it tastes incredible. It's like they have different people in the kitchen and you don't know who you will get. So 50 % of the time it's excellent.  UGH.,1
"I know people RAVE about this place, but frankly I find it A-OK. 

It is a great location, the food is fresh, and they have a great variety of vegan options. But I find it pretty blah otherwise. I've had the crispy ranch and the curry tofu and enjoyed both of them, but I feel like I expect more out of a specialty vegan place. I did really like chick'n in the crispy ranch. The fries are pretty good too. My green lemonade was way too sweet and lemonade-y for me. 

If I were you, I would try it because people love it so much and you get some unique items. But for the $10 range for a lunch item, I wouldn't  say it's nothing AMAZING.",1
"This place deserves a special mention.. it's not really on the heart of the city (for tourists), but it's definitely a place you should mark down for one brunch at least...shrimp n grits are hands down the best we've had in the city....the juices were fresh... and for a person who has a hard time eating Omelettes, Surrey's has converted me for sure.. the lump crab omelette with the sauce was just the cure for a dull grey rainy morning...! Word of caution-the place is always full, so make sure you get there at least 30 mins before you really want to eat, just to make sure you don't starve over the delish smells that keep on wafting out",1
"Had a very memorable birthday in SB and was so happy to have Wine Edventures be my gift! Sean picked us up Saturday morning and was super friendly (funny, too). It was just my husband and I along with a group of 10 - who happened to be all guys, having a bachelor party! Haha, so that was pretty funny. We stopped at 3 wineries and 1 brewery. Sean explained where we were as we were driving around and also gave us lessons at the tastings. He provided us with bottled water and souvenir wine glasses. We had lunch at the 2nd vineyard of the day, which was very good - choice of sandwich and a pasta salad side with chips and a cookie (the cookies are awesome). It was a fun day and I'd highly recommend this adventure to anyone looking for a fun day in the SB area.",1
"Beautiful clean shop with knock your socks off Everything ...
Homemade breakfast tarts and chicken pot pies .
All sweets looked well beyond beautiful and delish.
I felt some of the items were a tad pricey considering the sizes being on a smaller size. But I know premium quality costs more .. 
It's a great place for locals and worth a trip if traveling from center city etc .
I found counter staff to be most friendly and engaging 
Will be back and certainly will recommend",1
"Truly, I cannot say enough good things about this tiny, authentic, perfectly delicious eatery!  Growing up in the panhandle of Texas, we had plenty of authentic Mexican food in our home, and I'm always searching for good Mexican restaurants. El Limon is the best I've ever had in the state of Pennsylvania!  Sopes, tostadas, enchiladas, fajitas, burritos, fish tacos....all excellent and sooooo reasonable!  Waitstaff is always pleasant and attentive.  Best two features: homemade tamales and free margaritas!!  Bring the entire family for an amazing Mexican feast!  Ole!",1
"When I ordered my pizza for me and my friends , he pizza was so small and this delivery girl took forever and she was rude and didn't want to give me my change back and she said she thought I gave her a tip no ! And she didn't even give me the right change and it was all coins ! This place sucks ! DONT EAT HERE !!!!!!",-1
"I've been to New Day Meadery quite a few times, and every time I come I'm never disappointed! Normally when I come here I order the South Cider or the Shelby Blue Ribbon, but on my last trip I decided to taste one of their seasonal items. I tasted the Paulding Light which has cranberry, honey, and a touch of lime. It was pretty good, but was not as sweet as Shelby Blue Ribbon in my opinion. But that is what I like about New Day, they always have a variety of meads and ciders that everyone can enjoy, not just sugar fans like myself. All in all it is one of my favorite places in Fountain Square! Their service is always prompt and their staff always friendly.",1
"I tend to stay away from strip mall bars, that being said my buddy John is a bar back here and raved about it so we decided to give it a try. The food is very good, I will try their pizza next time, they also have a killer craft bar they just added, prices are very reasonable too",1
Thursday night and wonderful life music --- James Taylor style. Food is great and service friendly. Yummy red Sangria too!,1
"As a double date with a good long lost friend for a relaxing evening dinner, we were surprised in early august to not get reservations until 8. 
So we arrived an hour early and had drinks in the lobby while the piano man played beautifully. The bartender was a bit slow at first but kept us well tended. 
Our table in the corner against the glass was ready early and we enjoyed watching the rays chase fish around the bay as the sun set.  
I started with the tasty crab and corn chowder but was a bit disappointed with al dente potatoes in the bowl. 
Wife ordered the scallops which were superb as was my crab stuffed grouper. But my rice was also inadequately cooked. 
Creve brûlée was excellent as was Tim's attentive service. 
Worth going again, but they need to get all the parts of the dishes correct to get 5 stars.",1
"This is the McDonalds closest to my home, but I will forever drive any distance to find another bc it's a terrible restaurant. Even though it's not politically correct to say ""I love McDonalds"", every now and again and during lent we go to McDonalds and this one is really bad. Bad food, always cold or wrong items.  Bad service, and no offense to anyone but I cannot even communicate with most employees bc they don't speak any ENGLISH!!  I do not know much Spanish either but when I'm trying to spend my money in Fishers Indiana at a business I at least expect to be able to communicate in some way!  Their service is the slowest from any McDonalds in this area!  My advice: pass on this location unless you have allot of time and can speak Spanish !!!!",-1
I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!,1
"It saddens me to say this but I think I need a new nail salon. I have consistently come here for a few years now and the service has never been as bad as it has been the last few times I've been here. Here are my issues:

1) the girl at the front desk never once looked up from her papers while ""greeting"" me and asking me what I want. She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi. 
2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me.
3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet. 
4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi
5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up! 

I used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back. In the last 3 months, almost the whole staff has changed and these folks are not meeting my needs.",-1
"My husband Damon and I like to support local stores and establishments when we travel. Supporting the local economy any way we can helps us feel we are keeping real businesses alive. And being business owners ourselves we want all to prosper. So, when you go into this shop you will be pleased to find that all the goods offered are locally made, designed and or manufactured by locals. Its eclectic, and you can find clothes, artwork, food items and other stuff. The shop owner is friendly and smiles easily. We ended up with a dragonfly wall sculpture made from a chair leg, and pens that are space age and unique and were designed by a local gentleman. Check it out :)",1
"Being a vegetarian while visiting New Orleans is no easy feat.  However, when I have found eats, they are usually very good.  Tomasito's was below the standard I have gotten used to.  Not to say it was bad, not at all.  I had the chips and a bean and cheese burrito. I would have gotten rice in my burrito but it was not vegetarian (really?).  Service was ok, and the flan was excellent (although ""with berries"" seems to mean one raspberry).
That being said, at least there was food to eat on the menu, and that is not assumes in New Orleans.",1
"We stopped by a couple of weeks ago for Sunday brunch.  The food was very good and filling.  Nice drinks, and we had a very pleasant server.  Cool cafe space.  Overall a good recommend.",1
"I'm picky when it comes to pizza, and Brixx is a win every time! I love that their menu incorporates gluten-free options and perfectly sized lunch options. The wrap around bar also makes it the perfect stop to unwind after work, but arrive early, their patio fills up quickly!",1
"I like their salads, tea, and french fries! The servers were great...I've been here a few times and I'd come back!",1
"Salad portions are great. I always go with the Greek. One of the few Nick's spots that serves a rustic roast beef sandwich. Highly recommend that one. Pizza isn't that bad. I'd recommend an XL if having guests over. It's probably there better pizza, surprisingly.",1
"Great oyster happy hours that go on from 5-7pm! My boyfriend and I shared a dozen oysters and a glass of champagne. Our tab was $24 with tip. Great value! I hear they have the best to-go cups in town, and we totally missed out on that. The staff were very nice and attentive. We almost felt too casual but we felt at home! I'd definitely go back :)",1
This hospital is by far the best for families on the East Coast. They make seeing multiple MDs on the same day very easy and the quality of care is incredible. The renovated wing is fantastic with good accommodations for caregivers and friendly and attentive staff. I wholeheartedly recommend A.I. DuPont and will continue to travel from NY for my child's care.,1
I have purchased tires from Tires Plus in Flourtown at least 4 times. On this visit they mounted 4 new Michelins that I supplied. My car was worked on as soon as I arrived for the scheduled appointment at 9:00 and was returned to me within one hour.,1
"Western cycle is a huge store and sells everything to do with bikes. They've got your $150 kids' bikes with training wheels and your $5,000 racing bikes for triathletes. The staff are knowledgeable, and they've got a mixture of older, more mature and younger people, all of whom seem into biking. 

The one aspect I've enjoyed most about coming here over the years is how they keep returned, out-of-package stuff in a drawer and will sell it to you on discount. I once got $200 pedals for $60 just 'cause they were sitting in a drawer without their proper package. The guys work really hard here to keep their customers loyal, and it works. They're honest and well-trained. You're never left wandering without help. This and United Cycle are pretty much the only two bike places I'll shop.",1
"We had a great experience enjoying happy hour here! Vaughn and Mark are so kind, we will absolutely be back to get that same service. It's truly one of a kind. The free appetizer was awesome and the slot machines at the bar brought us luck. What a fun happy hour with amazing service!! It's a must!",1
Stay away from this dealership.  I have wrote about 3 different reviews on their site and I keep giving them one more chance but wont anymore.  My whole family drives Hyundai but constantly they find ways to screw you over.,-1
"I have only been here on a few occasions, mostly to send the random package, I like that this location has one of the automated machine (the post office closest to me does not...)

But what I wanted to highlight was the fantastic customer service my husband and I experienced when we went here to get our passport applications submitted, the representative we worked with was awesome. She was fast, friendly and knew exactly what needed to be done so we were in and out super quick! She even gave me the follow up forms and explained what I would need to do once I changed my name, perfect. I hope every experience here in the future is just as good. She should train everyone.",1
Staff member wouldn't let us use guest pass on our first time there. He said our only option was to buy at least a one day pass for $15/person. LOL. Went to Retro fitness for free trial; better equipment and environment:),1
I love this place. Super friendly staff. Great with kids. And the food is amazing. Especially the hash browns. You can also get tomatoes and grits on the side. Yum! And on top of it all it's not hard on the wallet.,1
"I'm giving this joint 4 stars because they have earned it, but they are definitely 5 star material, if they work out a few kinks. Granted, they just opened, so some of the errors I've experienced (I work in the area, so I've been there several times) will probably get worked out and they are more than willing to make corrections and accommodations when they mess up. 

But over all, the food is REALLY good. Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  

The Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. 

The fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries

The onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). 

Spanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good

Baklava - VERY GOOD! 

Signature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!

The (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. 

Overall, this place is great! Provided they don't stray from the high quality standard they are setting, I will keep going back.",1
"I've been coming to this place for years now, and even though I now live in Colorado, I come back here every time I'm in Philadelphia for work (which is often). I've tried many items on the menu and many were great, portions are generous, and prices are low. My go to item - Indian Mee Goreng, I can eat that every day of the week if I could, it's that good. Maybe one day I can get the recipe from the manager so I can actually do that on days I'm in CO.",1
"As a childless woman I wasn't sure how I was going to enjoy my experience here but I give the good folks at Chuck E Cheese credit....they do run a fairly tight ship. There are lots of staff running around both on the floors and behind the counters so whether you need to order another sample platter or get a refund after a machine ate your token you will never be stuck waiting too long. There is also staff at the door and they do stamp the kids to make sure they don't wander away on their own or with somebody they do not know.

I like that all the games here are just one token. There are also quite a few different types of games available from Arcade style to games of chance. One thing I did notice is that the game area is larger then the play area which means your kiddo's are more likely to want to spend their time here and your likely going to be reaching for your wallet on more then one occasion.

There was a decent amount of food sent to our birthday party table and even with six kids and five adults there was still pizza left over. I did find the birthday area to be a little crowded and we did on more then one instance accidentally back our chairs into people from the neighboring party table. 

The staff here were great and very attentive making sure all the special birthday rock stars were well looked after. I don't know how many times I would really need to come into a place like this as I don't have that many friends with kids but it was great to see them enjoying themselves as well as reliving some fond memories from my own trips to Chuck E Cheese as a little girl.",1
"Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped for dinner.  When we arrived there were only two other tables of patrons and a handful of people at the bar.   They promptly took our food order, but we waited 50 minutes for it to be delivered.   It was only a burger and a pork tenderloin sandwich.   Not sure why we didn't leave other than the fact we were watching football.  Food was just ok.

The people at the bar were so loud, offensive and obnoxious that I felt uncomfortable for an older couple that was dining.    What kind of management allows this kind of behavior?   

This place won't last.",-1
"We had a mixed experience at Mr. B's.  We started at the bar for drinks and a starter due to table wait. Bar was nice for a busy night. Our table was ready early so the bar staff transferred our starter to the table and things went down hill quickly. Starters were delivered and then we were ignored for over 45 minutes. No drinks, water etc. Finally a waiter in another section took out order. We ordered BBQ shrimp (best thing on our table), rabbit and wood plank grilled fish. Fish was a very small piece and not worth the $$$. Rabbit was good! Hit and miss service ruined the experience.",-1
Thoroughly enjoyed our private tour today with Carrie (it was very rainy so not too many visitors).  Her knowledge and passion about the Civil War was captivating. The Battle of Franklin deserves such a memorial.,1
"Wow!!  That really sums up, in a very good way, my interactions with Delicious Designs and Leigh Anne!  Our wedding was only planned two months out and was supposed to be very very small so no cake was needed.  As the weeks went by, the guest list increased, so I decided I wanted a cake.  With probably less than a weeks notice, Leigh Anne stepped up and made the exact cake I had in my head.  I asked for a simple two tier lemon cake with no decorations.  Not only did she make this happen beautifully, she made chocolate vegan cupcakes for my daughter at the last minute.    I'm attaching a picture of the cake ""table"".  My daughter did the decorating and I must say, for someone with not much in the decorating department, everything came out better than I could ever imagine.  And not only was the cake perfect, it was yummy delicious.  I can't wait for my one year anniversary to dig in to that top layer! 

If you are in need of any bakery needs in Reno and you don't use Leigh Anne with Delicious Designs, well then all I can say is I'm sorry!",1
"This place is so cute. The interior is adorable and casual. There's some small booths and chairs and tables for hanging out and enjoying your food/drinks. It's all so clean, too, which is a huge plus.
There's a little section with baked goods, some Asian and some more American. They have mostly Vietnamese food, but I also saw some other types of food (e.g bulgogi).
I came in with two friends and the woman who helped us was really personable and friendly. We ordered banh mi and boba tea, and sat down waiting for our food to be brought to us. The banh mi was really yummy, especially the bread. I had boba milk tea, which was as good as any milk tea I've had before. 
They have a drink card which you can get stamped to receive a free tenth drink. Definitely an incentive to return. Also, their hours are awesome, which is a huge plus.",1

Disappoint.",-1
"It's a young start up company. Patience is a virtue.
Many in the gun community lack this virtue, so be it.
Owner seems to be a stand up guy and has stood by his word in my dealings with him.
I met the owner, Jacob, at a gun show in Las Vegas where I purchased a Cerakoted billet lower.
Pretty quality work on the machining and Cerakote job.
Traded emails with the owner and always got a quick response with the information I requested.",1
"This is our ""go to"" place! The food is consistently good and we always have friendly attentive waiters to sometimes help with our decisions. One of our favorites is the pasta pockets with pear filling. Really delicious! It's also byob which is always a plus. This is a great restaurant with a real cozy, family atmosphere. Highly recommend.",1
"I started coming to Moreno when I moved back to Brandon and had an itch for Alessi Bakery but didn't  want to drive too far. Someone told us about Moreno so we gave them a shot! A great, small, FAMILY-OWNED (love it!) bakery right in the heart of Brandon. They make a HUGE variety of baked goods from fresh bread to huge cupcakes to flan and cookies! They also have the best freshly made cuban sandwich with their own special sauce spread! My favorite thing to get here are the almond sticks. I am a huge fan of anything almond, but these are so fresh with loads of almonds and almond flavoring! If you have a sweet tooth, this is DEFINITELY the place to go!",1
"Beautifully sweet ending to a sweet trip to NOLA with the girls. We stumbled upon this after a delicous savory lunch nearby at Cochon (review to follow). Sweet Confections is on Magazine St, around corner from the art gallery strip on Julia St.   We had a sampling of cupcake (chocolate with mocha filling) and truffles (raspberry, creme brulee, and orange).  Cupcake was good, mocha filling best part. Rasberry truffle was my fav, love the dark chocolate so it's not cloyingly sweet. The coffee was a wonderful chaser, not overly burnt, smoky, or acidic... I usually have coffee with milk n sugar, forgot this time, but I didn't even need it!  Seating was nice, with a few cafe tables inside. Enough for our 6-girl troop. And service was great, helpful with flavor suggestions and labelling.  Gave 4 of 5 stars because maybe they could benefit from one more equally gracious staff person.",1
"We've been shopping here since this location was a Wild Oats. Perhaps I'm just imagining things, but I'd swear it has gotten better since the merger of these two chains.

I love the produce, seafood and cheese here. But it's the personal care section with tons o' natural cosmetics, handmade soaps and the like that brings us in most often. Well, that and the salad bar. In the cooler months, nothing beats hitting Whole Foods for a post-yoga lunch of soup and salad or the deli salad sampler plate. The Carrot Ginger, Split Pea and Corn Chowder soups are the best! Other sure bets: the curried tofu salad (or pretty much any of the deli-made tofu items), sushi to-go boxes and the everything cookies. My most recent find: lavender soda - kinda' dry and really does relax you :-)",1
"The Penang chicken with the chicken flavor infused white rice will always be one of my favorite meals. Wether in Boston or in Philly, the quality is the same and I am a huge fan. When we came in the line was very long but surprisingly we were sat in about 15-20 minutes. The service was fast from start to finish so I didn't have to wait long before I could start eating the juicy amazing chicken. I was planning on getting an order to go to drive back to Virginia to eat but that seemed greedy so I didn't. I regretted that decision the second I got back home so next time, I will be greedy!",1
"I went here off of a referral. It was great I was done in five hours. I had individuals done, medium size and they cost 150 the hair included. There were three women that are on your head at one time. I will go there again! There very nice as well.",1
"Not mediocre at all IMHO.  Makes me wonder if Daniel O. went to the same place we did.

This is a great neighborhood byob place that provides welcoming service and excellent food at a reasonable price.  We started going here because numerous South Philly friends recommended it.  This is not foo-foo Italian.  This is not pretentious Italian.  This is ""let's go back and work our way through the menu"" Italian.  We found the specials to be good choices.  My husband's broccoli rabe and sausage was excellent, as was a grilled romaine salad with bleu cheese and pine nuts.  Both were generous enough to share.  Last time, sausage & figs was a hit.  If you are in the mood for a basic plate of macaronis with red gravy, you won't be disappointed either.  We had a great time with the waitress because my BIL brought a bottle of Great Wall wine from China (that was the 2nd bottle we opened) and that started a whole crazy discussion.  She didn't know us from Adam, but we left there feeling like regulars.

It's a very doable destination if you are on your way to a sporting event at the Linc or the Cit, or to the Spectrum or Wachovia Center.  For those who rely on public transportation, you can get off the subway at Broad & Oregon, then walk back a block to Broad & Porter.  Make a reservation, though because it can be a popular place.  You also want to make sure you have time to have a relaxing meal and make your event in time.",1
"I recently moved in a few blocks away from Henry's and was looking forward to having a neighborhood coffee spot not far from my house. So, on a beautifully humid August morning I walked over to check it. 

1) The atmosphere is pretty standard. Open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout. No college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either. Lacked uniqueness. 

2) The name Henry reminds me of Thomas the tank engine. Was there a train named Henry on there or not? If so, was he chill or not. Could add one star for chill train association. 

3) The coffee was not good. I got an iced coffee (STFU) and it was super bitter. The amount of ice in it wasn't obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk.

I'm coming back to try some hot coffee or espresso on a cooler day but damn Henry :((( not a great first impression.",-1
"This place is a gem.Attractive space, great location near Broad Street line, plenty on street parking. BYOB. I've been twice and enjoyed every dish. Highlights were the chaats, beef short ribs, lamb vindaloo, beet salad, breads/pickles, and chai. We got the chocolate cake for the table to share each time and everyone loved it. Can get takeout beer at the corner bar. We'll be back.",1
"Have only been once a couple of months ago, so maybe this was a one-off experience...Ordered a piece of carrot cake, which tasted fine. Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the ""fanciness"" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol). 

My problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.

I should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.

Four stars for the cake. Two stars for the service.",-1
Pancake Pantry is an institution in Nashville. A place to see country stars and have a great breakfast. Pancakes are good. It's a thing to do in Nashville. Plan to stand in line and enjoy the conversation.,1
"I know I shouldn't expect much but everything I asked for that was on the drive thru menu was not available. I was actually afraid of what I was going to get once I did get it. I saw the movie ""waiting"".  Word of advice stay clear of this arch. Just so you know I was only trying to order a beverage how pathetic is that.",-1
"Unless you have gray hair , are over 45 and appear wealthy , don't expect to get good service . My girlfriend and I sat there and witnessed our waitress cut up with many older couples in suits , then would check on us every half hour to 40 minutes , and didn't even check on our steaks and how they were prepared. The management never asked how our meal was ,(we witnessed them going table to table). VERY disappointed for spending $80, to get this poor of service .",-1
"Not just for feet. All I can say is....Wow! Worth the extra $$ for an hour full body massage. Simon has the most talented hands to coax your muscles to relax, taking the kinks out with skill. The atmosphere is very desirable and comfortable. You don't realized the importance of human touch until you have a professional work their magic. They provide walk-in service, but I recommend scheduling an appointment for a massage, especially during the early evening hours. My daughter and I had a foot massage there and this too was fantastic! First place whose prices are affordable and well worth indulging in. I highly recommend this little slice of heaven.",1
"Lots of improvements to this place. Much more comfortable environment now.  The chairs could be a bit more comfortable as it'd be nice to sit through an entire football game. Otherwise, this place has really improved.",1
"My sister-in-law and I visited this restaurant on 8/28/15 mid afternoon.  We were seated after requested 3 times that the hostess speak a little louder because we couldn't even hear her with the background music.  We were seated in a booth with a never ending Larry King vitamin commercial on the TV - really?  Our waitress introduced herself and a new trainee and then we never saw her again.  Two other wait staff seemed to be sharing our table, but no idea who was responsible for our table.  We got our drinks and ordered, but food took forever considering there was not more than 15-20 filled tables in the entire restaurant.  Burgers were not bad - I ordered the blue cheese burger and it would have been better with less blue cheese, way too much!  Fries and onion sticks were very good.  But no one came to see if we were satisfied, needing anything, etc and took two requests and waiting to get a carry out box.  There was a family seated across the aisle from us when we arrived and we assumed they had finished their meal and were ""hanging out"".  Only after we received our food did we understand they had already ordered and still did not have their food!  I doubt I will return to this restaurant in the future.",1
"We had dinner here after a long day at the convention center.  We asked to sit in a quieter area, and they found us a nice table in a side room.  Service was attentive and professional.  Our waiter recommended the aged ribeye steak--""best steak ever.""  I didn't think I wanted an entire 18-ounce boneless, so he suggested we split it.  We did--certainly one of the ""best steaks ever""--cooked perfectly medium rare and it was plenty for both of us.  Of course, we also had the signature shrimp cocktail (horseradish) and the iceberg lettuce wedge with crumbled bacon (very pancetta-like).   OK, iceberg wedge isn't the most exciting salad, but it's great when done well, which this was.  
   My only disappointment was a wine list that had a very limited choice of medium-priced wines by the bottle, so wine selection took a while.  A small complaint, so I would rate H & I  4.5 stars if possible.",1
"So I no longer go here which is a shame because The eyebrow waxing here is fantastic. I am giving this 2 stars because when I have contacted for an appointment via the phone, it usually has taken days for me to get a response. The online booking is useless because I rarely have found appointments within 2 weeks of when I need it (and I'm very flexible with time of day). 

I give up on this place. Unless you book out weeks in advance, you will not get an appointment. I'm now paying $10 more elsewhere which sucks but I'm able to get seen when I need to be seen.",-1
"My husband and I took my mother here for her 100th birthday!
We can't say enough about the treatment we received: from a great table and view, to delicious ""compliments of the chef"" extra dishes, to a beautifully decorated cake plate, to the warm and attentive servers. It was much more than we expected, even for this very special occasion. For us, it was a wonderfully memorable experience.",1
"Cozy and family friendly restaurant. I came here for a private engagement party, where the bride and groom to be had arranged for special menus and baked all of their desserts. There were a few booth tables reserved for presents, wine, and desserts. No room for side tables like in an actual special events space.

The wait staff was nice. From the limited menu, I picked the Penne Fellini, which has prosciutto di parma, peas, onions, and light cream sauce. The whole dish was literally this pasta swimming in sauce. It may have had a light cream flavor, but it was ladled heavily onto the pasta. I didn't have a desire to consume an entire meal of this, so I ended up not finishing.

It was a fun celebration, and we were really there for the friends and family, not the food. Oh, and we also had the bruschetta and salad, neither of which was very memorable. I wouldn't be thrilled to come back here, but I think it's awesome that they turned the whole restaurant into a venue for such a special occasion!",1
"My wife and I just moved to town and where saddened to have to move away from our local beloved Mexican restaurant.  We passed by this place several times knowing that once we moved in we would have to try it.  And OMG we where floored, the restaurant had great traditional ambiance and the service was top knotch.  They served glass bottle sodas which personally is something I love.  The food was amazing, my wife had the Taco Sombrero and I had the Chimichanga.  Both where amazing.  This place is 6 stars if I could give it.",1
Came here on a Monday at lunch time. I sat at the bar and received fast service. Ordered their carne asada taco lunch special which were better than average. More than pleased with this place,1
"De vacaciones y sin ganas de cocinar, decidimos (x8) pedir pizzas en este lugar para retirar y comer en el lugar en el que nos estábamos hospedando, que quedaba a 500 metros. Así que, un jueves de verano, las fuimos a buscar cerca de las 21.30 horas.
Entramos y nos pareció muy ameno, limpio y confortable para comer ahí. Nos atendió un hombre muy amable y atento.
Pedimos los siguientes sabores:
- prosciutto (jamón crudo);
- ham (jamón cocido);
- pepperoni;
- cebolla;
- hongos;
- anchoas y
- albahaca y tomate.

Las pizzas tardaron 25/30 minutos. Todos sus gustos -de los cuales subo foto- estuvieron deliciosos. El estilo de pizza fue a la piedra, con salsa de tomate y queso muzzarela en una cantidad ideal.
Si bien este comentario parece limitarse únicamente a una estricta relación precio-calidad, no menos verdad es que, en mi opinión, la calidez con la que fuimos recibidos reflejó cómo hubiera sido el trato de haber decidido cenar ahí mismo.
No dudo en valorar a este lugar con cinco estrellas.",-1
"Although there are countless little Mexican places below Washington Avenue, I never get sick of them and always look forward to trying the new kid on the block. This time it was El Sabor Poblano on Federal, which could not look less special if it tried.

I liked that there were 3 fish tacos on the menu.  I picked the fried and battered version, though the tortilla chip covered fish could have been awesome. I was instantly impressed when I opened one of my three and found that El Sabor puts an entire filet of fish in each taco! The flakey meat had no fishy taste. These tacos came with the more American toppings of lettuce and, tomato, and cheese. I bet I could have gotten cilantro and onion if I asked. The sole staff member in the place seemed happy to accommodate us- well, we were the only ones dining in.

Another taco filling option that comes with more traditional toppings is the super crispy chorizo, only $8 for 3. There was no detectable gristle here, something I have often come across at this little places.

As unassuming as it looks, this particular South Philly Mexican place is worth stopping by.",1
"Love this bakery!! Great breakfast sandwiches, coffee, and donuts! My friend and I love coming on weekend mornings",1
"Just tried the food. It was excellent, the best  I have had in the area. Had kung pao beef and basil shrimp with the pork fried rice all very good. Delivery was fast as well",1
"Fun, no-frills atmosphere, right on the water, where you can watch passersby and dolphins alike, while enjoying great food and accommodating service.

Members of our dining party ranged from a picky 7 year old, to two 40 somethings and a 72 year old grandmother. Captain Bill's had menu choices for everyone in our party, and they even made some ingredient substitutions for us. 

The food arrived hot, fresh, and exactly to our specifications. Wait service and wait time were on point, and we all left the restaurant satisfied and having enjoyed the experience. We'll be back to Captain Bill's next time we visit John's pass. I hope you consider it too!",1
"It saddens me to say this but I think I need a new nail salon. I have consistently come here for a few years now and the service has never been as bad as it has been the last few times I've been here. Here are my issues:

1) the girl at the front desk never once looked up from her papers while ""greeting"" me and asking me what I want. She mumbled under her breath to go pick out a color then yelled across the salon that I was getting a mani and pedi. 
2) once I picked out my color I went back to the front and someone who came in after me was seated in a pedi chair, water turned on etc. to get service. Once she saw that I was standing in the front she got a chair going for me. The problem with that is there were no more nail technicians available to work on me.
3) so now I'm sitting in cold water waiting for someone to come and do my feet. 
4) the pedicure started, she painstakingly dug into my toes (which I absolutely hate) and rushed through the Massage part of the pedi
5) after it was all said and done, I find out that their prices have gone up! 

I used to come here because they have later hours and are open on Sunday's but after a 3rd terrible experience here I am not coming back. In the last 3 months, almost the whole staff has changed and these folks are not meeting my needs.",-1
"Cute lil spot on Germantown Ave. I came in craving something sweet and they did not disappoint. There was an array of cookies and bars to choose from, if my memory serves me right. Behind the display of goodies there was a table with clear plastic cups filled with yumminess, labeled ""cake scrapple"" I was intrigued. They were different kinds of cakes and icings, most likely left over from a bake. There were about 5 different flavors to choose from and I went with my favorite Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting. I also ended up with an M&M cookie, my other fave! It was a nice day so I sat outside on their bench and had a couple bites of goodness! The cookie was great, soft & chewy with those hard candies for texture. The cake was also delicious and moist!",1
"We are frequent patrons who enjoy their super fun bar, tv's and music selection.  The service is very good.  Nice, hard-working, mannerly people in a very cool atmosphere that appreciate the business.  Food is consistently fresh(seafood) and good.  Pizza is the best in South Jersey and my husband, the unofficial pizza 'officianado' makes me try them all, from NYC, to Trenton to Philly, Delaware, Chicago.  This is really the best pizza I've ever had. The crust is thin, crispy yet has a nice chew, and flavorful.

Last night I had a dinner special of chicken cutlet in a lobster, white -truffle oil, light cream sauce with asparagus, shallots and sundried tomatoes over angel hair pasta. On the Special's menu it is listed as a veal entree, but the kitchen was more than happy to substitute Chicken for me. The dish was so delicately seasoned with such a fine touch that I enjoyed smelling it almost as much as tasting it. In addition, it was such a generous portion that I enjoyed it two nights later for dinner and now want to go back tomorrow and order it again!!  What an absolutely fabulous recipe. Very fine, subtle flavor but also comforting and satisfying. 

Not to mention, Selena the Bar Manger, bartenders Jayna and Chris are just so pleasant, professional and helpful, it really is a great place to go!

Enjoy!!",1
"Fabulous! Best happy hour, fresh menu, Delish- drinks, if I had the time, I'd come here every day!",1
This is one of the busiest Chick fil A's I've seen but they always manage to be quick and have exceptional service! I seriously don't know how they can be so quick and great all the time! One of my favorite places!,1
"This hotel was fantastic. I was in town for a week, working at my company's PA office in Wayne. Great location and easy to get in and out. Hotel staff was very friendly. Room was immaculately cleaned and very spacious for just one person. Kitchenette was fully stocked with dishes, silverware, utensils, a small dishwasher and a full size fridge. Windows surrounding the king size bed were great- lots of natural light. I liked that opting out of housekeeping got me a $5 credit at the restaurant. 

The pool is small but no one was there the two times I went to use the hot tub. The bar has a decent drink selection, although I was bummed they were out of mint and couldn't make a mojito (which was on the drink menu). Burger was okay. Dessert was mediocre (but free with my $5 credit, so nbd). Omelet station was a nice touch in the AM. Coffee frequently had coffee grounds in it/was very weak, but the breakfast spread overall was nice.",1
"im going to have to give this place one star for its horrible customer service:

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it's only on certain days, ""it says it right on the sign,"" i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you're not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a 'domino effect,' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other 'dominoes' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you're one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you'll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you're like me (principled) and you don't like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut",-1
"We stopped in for brunch and we weren't expecting the food to be so delicious.  The 3 meat hash was amazing, as was the turkey sandwich and bagel/salmon.  The employees were very friendly and accommodating.  A little pricey, but well worth.  We will visit again if in the area.",1
In love with my haircut! Very reasonable prices as well. This is my second time here. The first time the cut and style were amazing but the color was a little off from what I wanted but it still looked good. I will definitely continue to be a returning customer.,1
"Adorable little shop. The food/snacks were great and the portions generous but of course the alcohol is the star. While I wasn't too big on the meads, the ciders were wonderful and I ended up enamored enough to bring one all the way back home to the east coast.",1
"Excellent tasting Po-Boys but it could have had mire catfish, pretty skimpy.
Service, very good.",1
Large menu. Clean restaurant and restroom. Friendly staff. They were fairly busy in the middle of the day when we visited. This was my first time here and all we had was a sandwich so I can't give them 5 stars yet but for a family style restaurant and bar we enjoyed our meal. They had a decent draft beer selection and also serve wine and mixed drinks. There are crayons on every table and instead of a single place mat they put a large sheet of white paper on the tables for the kids to draw on.,1
"If you're looking for a great brunch place in New Orleans, definitely come here!

My boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it! We both started with the Brandy Milk Punch, which was divine.  If you are of age, order this drink!  It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  

They bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small, but it includes a duck springroll, fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce, which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.

For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day, which was blackened Mahi Mahi, and he loved it.  

Definitely go to Mr. B's!",1
"I find it hard to believe there are so many people with such low standards when it comes to the Daily Bread.

It is a ripoff of St. Louis Bread Co/Panera Bread, which in of itself I don't mind at all.  I have eaten multiple times at the Daily Bread and have yet to have an enjoyable experience.  The food is so-so at best.  Their sandwiches are basic and lack any real flavor.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was okay.  

I certainly wouldn't steer anyone away from this place based on the food.  The food is basic and simple, not bad but also nothing great.

My biggest qualm with the Daily Bread is the service.  The majority of the workers seem utterly uninterested in helping out.  There was a line of about 6 people and one person at the register.  There was no sense of urgency to help any of the customers in line.  We waited for a good 5-6 minutes to put an order in.  After receiving our cups to get our drinks we looked for a clean place to sit and eventually settled on a table top that was the least dirty of the tables available.  There were plenty of open spots but it just appeared as though there was lots of trash left behind.  Does anyone bus these tables?

I anticipate that people are responsible for cleaning up after themselves, but it appeared as though the tables hadn't been effectively cleaned in a while.  There was also some trash on the floor that hadn't been addressed as well.

The order number was called and the order was only halfway completed.  When we asked which sandwich was ours, we were basically ignored as the girl put up two more orders.   After another few minutes the rest of the order came up and we began to eat.  I tried both items and as I stated before, both were okay.  The problem is that the food was just unable to make up for the lack of organization, the slow speed at which we were served, or the cleanliness of the restaurant.

After 3 attempts, I'm writing the Daily Bread off and won't return.  I'd rather go to St. Louis Bread Co, get the same level of food, but in a clean environment and a timely setting.",-1
"Super lunch option
Watch out for the yoga mats
You won't miss the meat

Lunch has been very strange for me since HipCity opened. Because here's the thing: I am a meat eater. I mean like my last meal on earth would be a burger. Or, just maybe, the fajita wrap. Because it's that good.

Haven't had everything on the menu yet, but everything I have had has been great. The buffalo bella and crispy hipcity ranch are amazing sandwich alternatives, especially paired with the green lemonade. The groothie is also delicious, and can stand on its own to get you through an afternoon if you only want to spend a few bucks.

Okay suffice it to say that the food is great. The staff is also very friendly, and when they get busy someone will come out along the line and take orders so congestion doesn't get too bad at the register itself.

My only issue with HipCity is that it is at times nearly impossible to figure out where to stand when you're waiting to order or waiting for your food. People kind of convene everywhere and it can get awkward when there's a line out the door. In such a small space it's hard to rectify, but if I see a line out the door I tend to walk on by not because it's a long wait (they're really efficient), it's just difficult to navigate the interior.",1
"After waiting 40 min to get in....
-Hot breakfast served cold.
-Food not prepared as requested (requested sausage links burnt, even after sending them back still not as requested. Eggs requested as over-medium, whites were runny).
-had to ask for refills on coffee.
-waitress seemed apathetic to deficiencies.
-once finished, we waited more than 10 minutes to get check, long enough to write , review and post this review.

Only had one experience with this place and it will be my last. I called in the night before to ask if they sell deboned duck and the man on the phone said they could but I would have to request it the day of. I called the following morning to ask to pick up a plain deboned duck and whoever the incompetent girl who answered had trouble getting my order clear. I picked up my order and came home to find that not only did they gave a whole duck with stuffing I never asked for. I called the place back and thy never offered any compensation of any sort except a trade in right as it's a hour before dinner time and the butcher shop is more than thirty minutes away for me. Shame that food from this place is overshadowed by their terrible customer service.,-1

"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I had the worst experience when we went today for brunch that I've ever had in a restaurant since I moved to Tucson 7 years ago! First, before even going today, I called to find out what the brunch entailed and when Rosie answered the phone I told her that I had a few questions about brunch, she told me to hold and never came back to the phone. I stayed on hold for 8 minutes at which I called back and spoke to someone else who just seemed like ""Oh Well."" This brunch was organized by one of my friends, so choice in location was not something I had. We did have a reservation, but were pushed outside because apparently they only planned for one 8 person table and the other table got there a few moments before us and got to choose. The problem with this is that there were two people in our group that are allergic to bees, myself being one of them, and bees were flying all around our table, especially our food. At one point I had to get away from my seat and was not able to return to it for 5 minutes because the one been landed on my waffle and was not leaving. 

At this point my friend and I recognized the danger for the two of us and asked to be moved inside to which we were told ""No."" When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told ""Well, what did you want?"" That's when the manager came up, I explained the situation and he was going to put us at one table to which our waitress, gotten by the hostess came up and said to him ""I already to her that they could not move in here."" What employee talks like that to their boss! The waitress proceeded to run outside and tell the rest of the group that we were moving at which point they decided to stay outside, which was fine by my friend and I, but that meant having to be separated from our friends. This, to me, is deplorable behavior on the side of the the waitress and management. The waitress who was supposed to be our waitress inside as well, never arrived to the table and never checked up on us. Needless to say, I had to get another waiter and he was so appalled with the way that everything was handled he told my friend to not give him a tip. I was so appalled myself, that I did not eat because I just did not want to spend my hard earn money at this establishment any longer. I would never recommend this place to anyone even if they were starving!",-1
"This is a must try, we come here frequent and we are never disappointed. Get there early so you get right in and don't have to wait. Decent selection of coffees, they have french press as well. Menu isn't huge which is nice so you can figure out what you want quickly. Food comes how in a decent time. I seem to always get the same thing (wilburt skillet) everytime I go cause it is amazing. Food just seems so fresh as well, friendly staff. You will leave full and a smile on your face.",1
"They sat us within 5 minutes and then took 40 minutes to even bring out sodas. The table next to us had the same server and got their good before their beverages came out. After almost an hour there with no drinks we tracked down a manager who told us our good never even got entered. I'm on my honeymoon and the friend we were there with had a date to make. Appetizer was the only thing to make it out and was decent boneless wings. Even with the manager begging us to let her get our food together free and not walk out, the service was beyond dismal and slow. First and last time coming to a Beef's. Made us all late. If we had waited at our table for the food we would have made our year anniversary before it came out. Better choices for food elsewhere. Avoid this place at all costs",-1
"I finally made it to Farmhaus last Saturday, and it was worth the wait.  

As expected for a weekend, it was crowded.  We arrived about 15 minutes early and had to wait on the bench back by the bathrooms for a few minutes.  However, as I said, we were earlier than they anticipated, and they got us to the bar as soon as seats opened up.  They wisely gave us a copy of the menu to be prepared once we were seated, and we did indeed plan our entire meal in advance.  This was helpful, because we were actually seated about 20 minutes late, and I was about to eat the menu itself as I drooled over the descriptions!  

The smoked fish dip and escolar with prawns were fantastic- the standouts of the meal.  The mushroom salad and tapenade were also very good.  The meatloaf was good, but a little on the dry and bland side.  I wanted to get the nachos, but there were no other takers in my group....next time....

Service was good.  It was a bit shaky at times, but it was slammed the whole time we were there and that small space must be tough to work in.  

I would love to go back and check out their blue place special lunches...I have heard amazing reviews.  I think I will head back for dinner when there is outdoor seating, as I think that would add to the experience.",1
"A short walk from my apartment I was told about a small, welcoming cafe very popular for breakfast and brunch. It did not disappoint! I had a salmon scramble with egg whites the first time i went. The second time i went i got the tofu with brown rice breakfast plate. Both meals were great!! And i was seated quickly",1
"Beautiful decor, great atmosphere, amazing food! My husband and I were thinking how it's NY prices but better quality than most we have had at this price point. He had udon noodles and I had a few rolls (Spicy Salmon is a must!) Flavors were great- not too strong but tasteful! :) We enjoyed our experience!",1
"This place was definitely the best dining experience I had in NOLA during my week-long trip! My husband and I walked in without reservations during their Sunday Jazz Brunch. We waited about 40 minutes, but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied. 

Despite the place being ridiculously busy, our server didn't rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I've encountered. 

The food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I've ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme brûlée for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I'm guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. 

The coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B's (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! 

Our bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I'm in NOLA again, I'm definitely revisiting Mr. B's.",1
"Excellent customer service. I wish I could rent from there more often! Had such a great experience verses other car rental services. 

Rent if you can!",1
So I decided to give this place a shot after reading all the reviews on yelp. The place was dead but I have it a shot. The food was okay at best. I actually left there and went across the street to Charlie's. The place was packed and one bite of the redtop pizza and I cursed myself for not coming here first. If you want a sit down meal this place is nice. If you want good pizza go to Charlie's.,1
I went here based on the Yelp reviews and found everything to be true. The staff is extremely helpful and willing to answer all questions. I will continue to bring my bike repair/maintenance needs here.,1
"Wish I would have came on Yelp and read the previous reviews, it would've saved me a lot of time and frustration. I ran in today to see if someone could take a look at my right passenger front wheel. My tire pressure light was on and I noticed a piece of tire was lifted. I go in and he tells me it's a couple hours wait. Ok, I'll give you that I just showed up so the wait thing is to be expected. I ask the guy if I can make an appointment to come back. He says its first come first serve. Really? When I've made appts previously with other Just Tires? Why not just say you don't want my service? Bottom line? Guy was rude and lacked any customer service. Went down the street to Mr. Tire and was in and out with a replaced new tire in half an hour. Oh, and they appeared WAY busier based on the waiting area and cars in the garage.",-1

"Thethey even admitted it. Visit during the week around 3pm. Continuous failure!!!"" order process for the drive through is a complete failure and waste of time. Currently 4 out of four for not getting the order correct. Missing items every time. Too much playtime in there with the kids. This restaurant performs horrible compared to others. After my complaint ",-1
"The ambience and decor were nice. The nachos were good, along with a few choice options. However, do not order a cheeseburger. It is not only tiny, but it looks like something that was dropped off the back of a McDonald's truck as it was driving through a bad neighborhood. It was over cooked, dry, and just plain nasty. I was very disappointed to find such a flop in a restaurant that seems to be filled with blockbusters. The overall experience was fine, but that burger sure did ruin it.  The fries were another disappointment all their own.",-1
"Was here about a month ago. The food here is great but the waitress we had was terrible. She stood at the bar...saw every move we made and did nothing. We waited for our appetizer....waited for our main course.... waited for her to notice we were done. Then it was like she was doing the world a favor by waiting on us. I had been here several times. I left her no tip.

The stars for the food.... no stars for her.",-1
"While I was moving in and had all my stuff on my patio the inspector left a note that was threatening :
Stating I had inappropriate items on my patio 
Trash left out 
EXCUSE me but I was moving !!!!!!
So I went to the office and a woman named Deborah helped me ..
Very condescending .. Acted like I had no right to complain about my note...
Then I asked for a copy of my lease.. Oops again .... 
We're sorry you can't have that it's under lock and key!!! WHAT!!!!!
This volley of info and rudeness continued until she came out and said they were closing the office for the night!!
WOW what a difference from my rental I'm Asheville NC.. Friendly clean always remembered who we were even though it was a huge complex..
Ohhh , they will be friendly when you are looking but once you sign the dotted line ....not so great!!!!
You're just a number , you mean nothing to SENTINAL CORP believe me or they would have a nicer staff and wouldn't have to threaten you when your trying to get all your stuff put away!!!!",1
"Ew. I don't know what upsets me more, the borderline gross food or how much I had to pay for it. We waited forever to get into this place which served me a relatively tasteless burger on an incredibly soggy McDonald's quality bun and the saltiest fries I have ever eaten. Yes, truffle oil is delicious, but pouring it over burned, greasy fries does not a delicious, 16 dollar meal make. We won't be back.",-1
The food was good but towards the ends my family and I were splitting the bill and they charged my family the the right amount but ran my credit card last and charged me the full amount of $250 I talked with the director and all he can say is i don't know what to say we'll refund it but will take a few days. I don't have of couple of days for $250.  I told them I'm not from here and I just can't come back if something is wrong and all the director could say is sorry can't help you.,-1
Used to be good when it first opened.  Quality has gone downhill.  Ordered the mango salad which came out with apples instead.  (no explanation provided)  Food is mediocre - have been there about 5 or 6 times since it opened but not returning even though it is walking distance from our house.,1
"Sitting at Jiffy Lube getting an oil change making me think of my car... Which makes me think of Carl's.

The owner's name is Mike and him and I go way back. One of the few people I still like after giving them about $5k. 

This man will tell you like it is. What you can wait to fix, what you need to fix, and when it might be time to throw in the towel (he told me if I need another big repair I should part ways with my VW).

He truly has done all the major repairs on my car.

And he is a really nice guy. He once did a free oil change because I had just spent so much. Last time? I had him replace the wires, coils, and shock plugs in my car and it was raining outside. I live about a couple miles away and Mike offered me a ride. When I turned him down he gave me his own umbrella. 

Which is pretty fabulous service. Service you probably wouldn't get anywhere else.",1
"A few weeks ago, I over heard one of the management tell an employee in front of customers that he doesn't like white people. Walked out before even being seated. Not going to give them my money if that is their attitude. Obviously I am unwelcome.",-1
"Food is expensive and not worth it. My hubby had carnitas - very dry. I had the scallops- expensive and undercooked. Not even a browned crust. Rice was served ""family style "" but do mushy and overlooked. I had a mango margarita that was completely bland and flavorless. We will not be going back. City fish was not good, but this is worse. And so disappointing- the idea of fresh quality Mexican food could have been so good.",-1
"I was so excited for this trip. I hadn't taken a vacation in years. I booked the king size bed with whirlpool tub for some romantic relaxation with my boyfriend. We were visiting Tahoe but decided to stay here specifically for that room. 

We check in, all is well and we get to our room and it's a basic two queen room. We go back to the front desk and explain that this isn't the room I paid for. The front desk explains, ""Yeah,  there was an emergency and now the rooms are unavailable, so I took off ten dollars."" 

I was livid. They took my card without first informing me that my room had been changed. I would not have spent the extra gas to stay in RENO, if it meant staying in a generic room I could have booked anywhere. I felt very cheated. 

The fact that they ran out of fruit every morning at breakfast was beyond frustrating. 

We plan on visiting Tahoe again soon but we won't be staying here or Marriott ever again.",-1
I ordered a BLT from here and it came with bacon crumbles on my sandwich. It was also made with shredded lettuce. So the sandwich was just falling out all over the place. I mean who makes a BLT with crumbled bacon? I would have never ordered that if they told me before. I returned the sandwich and didnt order any further food. Wont order from here. Ever again.,-1
The restaurant looks nice. We order two sushi rolls and one tuna tartare.  tuna tartare was ok but the other rolls were really...bad .the taste are just not right! They gave a discount coupon for us but not sure we want to go back again,-1
I like the atmosphere in the restaurant but the food is terrible.  I was shocked at how bad the pizza was.,-1
"Hubby and I were looking for a fresh seafood restaurant and stopped here late on a Saturday afternoon. I ordered the tenderloin because I miss the good midwestern tenderloin sandwiches. For those. not from the midwest where breaded tenderloin was originated I'm sure they considered it great. BUT it was breaded with a much-too-garlicky seafood breading, NOT cracker crumbs as that are meant to be. I tasted that breading for hours afterward.  The fries were pretty good, however. The biggest problem is the restaurant was nearly empty and yet it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food.  Our waitress was very friendly but didn't apologize for the delay.",1
"Stopped in for breakfast on 12/2/17 I used to like it here for breakfast.  Service was slow coffee was not hot, grits were only warm and twenty minute wait for cinnamon biscuit after breakfast was brought to table then ten minutes to pay at counter to get out of the place there are better places to get breakfast in the area.  Should have went with my first choice instead of here.",-1
"Every time we come here and things seem to be getting better and back to the way they were.

Despite the lightning game we were seated quickly and our server David promptly brought us waters and took our order.

Our food arrived at the table quite fast and was the best its ever been.

After previously posting many negative reviews I am proud to report that new management has definitely turn this place around for the better.

Keep up the good work Hablo Taco !!",1
"Stop reading reviews and bring your pet to this clinic! I can't say enough good things about this clinic and the staff. I have an older Brussels Griffon who was showing signs of discomfort and they were closed when I decided to start looking for a vet. (I'm new to the area and hadn't picked one yet.) My message was returned before 8AM the next morning, and they got me in by 9 AM. The on site lab, pharmacy and X-ray made my visit seamless. The staff is incredible, and they cared for my dog the way I would expect someone to care for a family member. I'm happy to say my old girl is doing fine after the incredible care she received here. I have another dog who I am absolutely bringing in for his annual checkups, and anything else he might need. It's a relief to say I've found a Veterinarian for my fur babies. I've had my dogs for 9 years, and wish I had started taking them here 9 years ago. I've taken my pets to some good clinics in the past, but this clinic really set the standard for veterinary care. The only down side is that it's a little hard to see the entrance if you don't know where it is. Drive slower when you get close and you'll be fine.",1
"Great setting. Food & service did not match the hip bar/restaurant. My friends and I (6 people) had a reservation for brunch on Sunday. We were the only table there and the bar was less than full. It took a very long time to get our drinks. Our server was not attentive. We weren't going to get our bottomless mimosas waiting around for her bc she was sitting & rolling silverware chatting it up with her co-worker. So I took our glasses directly to the  bartender for our refills instead. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered the hot chicken tacos which wasn't spicy at all. My friends ordered the lox, it was fishy and it was more like smoked salmon flakes; no actual slices of smoked salmon. Pricey for what it was. The steak my friend ordered was very salty. A very bad representation of Nashville eateries. I do not recommend going here.",-1
"I recently bought $50 worth of hair products I was specifically looking for.  While I looked three salespeople were in a conversation a few aisles away.  When I was walking toward the cashier, one asked if I needed any help.  Yes about ten minutes ago!  The first thing the cashier asked me was, ""What's your phone number?""  Really?  No ""hello"", have you found everything you were looking for?""  I responded it was unlisted. She looked panicked and told me it didn't go anywhere.  Then why ask?  She then asked me if I had a daughter?  I could give her phone number.  OMG, totally inappropriate question.  Besides if I'm not giving you my phone number why would I give you my daughter's she assumed I had?  I told her I don't give out personal information.  

I most likely will continue shopping there, but please stop this policy of asking customers for their phone numbers!!",-1
"DISMAL. 1st medium rare steak was cooked so much it was shoeleather. Brown all the way through. The manager John offered to colk another himself. Atfer 15 mins a RARE steak xame out. John then made excuses and asked if I wanted a cupcake.. saying ""At least I know they are good."" Avoid at all costs until a real chef is working there.",-1
"It kills me to not give 5/5 stars because the food here is completely amazing!  However the service here is terrible!  I have eaten at the restaurant in Rivergate many times so I was thrilled to discover that there is one in Smyrna.  

We had the crab wontons which were completely out of this world!  They were so large and meaty and were served with a delicious sauce.

As my entree I chose the drunken fried rice.  WOW it was delicious and wonderfully spiced.  It tasted so fresh and there were so many interesting textures and flavors going on.  Also the portion size was more than generous.

Unfortunately it was hard to enjoy the food because despite the spices there were hardly any refills.  The waitress rarely even came to our table.  It seemed like they didn't have enough staff to run the restaurant due to the high volume of take out orders being called in and picked up. It seemed as though there was no order to anything.  What was weird is that there were 3 people in the kitchen (1 cooking and 2 just hanging around) and 2 out front running around looking overwhelmed. It is so unfortunate to find a restaurant that serves such good food but has service that is lacking.  Perhaps I came in on a bad night for them. They really need to hire another person to wait tables and manage refills.

Unfortunately I think take out would be the best way to get experience this restaurant.",-1
I ordered 5 dozen cupcakes for my wedding two weeks before the big day. I called the morning of my wedding and was told they were ready. I picked up and only 3 dozen were made. NOT HAPPY. Considered yourself warned.,-1
"I was looking for Oliver Peoples Sir Finley in a discontinued color.  I couldn't find them at my usual optometrists office in California or at the local Oliver Peoples store.  My usual optometry place called Oliver Peoples directly and they confirmed they had discontinued the color I wanted and didn't have any in stock either in their stores or factory.  I found the glasses on The Eye Bar website but wanted to confirm that they had the glasses in stock so I called.  Stacey said she did not have the glasses at this location but she would call around to see if any of their sales reps had them in stock in their other locations.   I got a call back about a week later and they found the glasses.  I ordered the glasses online right away and received them today, it was perfect, complete with the limited edition case.  I just wanted to thank Stacey and the staff for going above and beyond to find me these elusive glasses.  Your service exceeded my expectations and I am a very satisfied customer.",1
"I have to say that the food here is good; however, the staff/service could be better. My sister and I came here for lunch and a few drinks. My sister ordered a drink off the menu and 10+min later, as we're finishing our lunch, the waitress comes back and says ""sorry, our bartender doesn't know how to make that"" ..... So the bartender doesn't know how to make the drinks listed on the menu? And the 10+mins. it took to tell us that, it could have ben googled and made. I don't want to bash this establishment, but the customer service has always been an issue here. I would recommend continued training to both current and new staffers to improve their level of knowledge and customer service",1
"I don't understand why people go to Moe's- I've been to two different locations and the food is just disappointing-very bland!! The pico at this particular location looked like it was a few days old, luckily the salsa bar made up for it. Queso was good, but I just think there are better options...I wont be back ",-1
"Yikes, I just got that hard nasty piece of chicken that usually ruins Chinese restaurants for you. Bad, very bad. The worst. The steak and shake next door was so busy they had to close, and I should have known since no one was in line at Wendy's. most disgusting fast food I've ever experienced, crazy that this was the absolute worst. Garbage food.",-1
"This place has potential but feels so disorganized. A few months ago, I bought a Groupon for classes here. I called with some questions and left a message, but no one ever got back to me. The Groupon voucher said it was good for specialty or regular classes. I went on a Sunday and was told it wasn't good for Sunday classes because they are drop-in classes. Not sure how I could have known this since the voucher didn't say Sunday classes were excluded... The Groupon was expiring soon and so I really wanted to redeem the voucher, and they finally agreed to let me use it for that day. 

Last night I signed up and paid for zumba class this morning and dragged myself out of bed only to discover the class was cancelled because they have special workshops today. I've been assured I'll get a refund, but come on - the class should have been cancelled in the system! 

On the other hand...the classes are a lot of fun. I've mainly attended Peter's zumba class and love it! He is so upbeat and energetic - his class is a great way to start off my Saturday morning. I've also attended a class called Pound that uses special drumsticks, and it was a lot of fun. The prices are very reasonable as well. If you decide to go, be sure to bring your own water - oddly enough there isn't a water fountain, at least not that I've seen.",1
"Awful. Avoid this place. I took my car here on a slow Sunday morning. When I got home I noticed a good size ding and scratch on my driver side rear door. I took it back and spoke to a manager named Chris. He was not helpful at all. His response was ""there is nothing here that would have done that."" So why was it not there when I came in, and now it's here. He had no answer or solution. I asked for the corporate number. He told me I could call his GM who will decide if it needs to go to corporate or not. Thanks Chris, very helpful. 

When asking what their policy is for incidents, he could not give me an answer. All he would say is ""there is nothing here that would do that."" It's a car wash, thousands of moving parts and things touching the car. There is most definitely something that could do that. Especially when I watch the guys drying the the cars put the rags on the ground and pick them back up to continue drying the cars. Rocks, nails, anything hard. 

I expected more. I cannot imagine this is the first time this has happened, and by the looks of how seriously they take responsibility, it won't be the last.",-1
"This review is based on my one experience here that was for a large birthday party. We think the wings were so tasteless because they had to make so many for us ahead of time. We had, I'm guessing, around 50 people here for the party so there was a lot of wings. The ""hot"" wings were lacking any flavor at all. They simply tasted like chicken wings. The rubbery exterior I can certainly attribute to them having been made well in advance of our arrival, but the lack of spice?? They also prepared sliders that were very dry and rather bland. Service was not too bad considering the amount of people we had. On the plus side the nachos were very good and the beer was Über cold! We had a good time with family and friends, and we will give them another try (just not with a huge party again 'cause they kinda dropped the ball there).",-1
"I have to say it was....mediocre. really nothing more. 

Yes, the live music was enjoyable but thats really the best I can give it.

The food was....food. nothing really special in my opinion. My boyfriend had the filet mignon and didn't really even finish it. he also tried the potatoes au gratin and said it tasted almost as though they used easy-mac cheese on them. 
I had the vegetable platter and thats all it was. I have experienced amazing vegetable sides at other restaurants, but this entree was nothing to write home about.

As for desserts he had the cheesecake, which was fine, not amazing but nothing bad to say about it either. I had the strawberries and once again, thats all it was. Don't expext them to come out plated amazingly or even with whipped cream, they're only sliced strawberries.

Honestly, for the money I don't think it was worth it. I can think of many other places in the city, some of which are much cheaper, that are much more worth your time.",-1
"Really disappointed. I've been to the Marathon at 18/Spruce and had excellent service, drinks and food. Thought that would transfer to this location - not at all.

To sum it up, our server was extremely energetic, but not in a good way. More like a frantic energy. I was there to enjoy a few drinks and dinner with a friend who was visiting (AKA looking to spend money AKA you will get a larger tip if you let us stay longer) and we were rushed out. Server brought boxes for food we were still eating, without asking if we wanted them. A few minutes later he physically put the food in the boxes at the tableside while mumbling something like ""I don't like food sitting on the table."" .....we didn't even want to take it home. Next, when we said we were having another friend join for another round or two of drinks he told us we couldn't stay at the booth we were at and we needed to go to the bar. What? I point blank asked him if he was kicking us out of the booth and he said ""yes!"" energetically. There was no one waiting for tables and there were numerous open tables/booths around the restaurant. I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave immediately. Our friend joined after all this happened, and when the server came over to ask if they wanted a drink, he seemed surprised when we told him we were just going to leave. YOU LITERALLY just told us we couldn't sit at this table any longer!! We then left.

I worked in restaurants for a long time and I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to restaurant service. I was not pleased at all during this visit.

On another note, the food was not that great.",-1
"So I'm quite certain I will never be returning to this restaurant. Upon walking in the manager greets us and asks where we were from. A friend of mine, and the only one amongst us from Louisiana, responded. The manager came back with a comment about my friend being from a trailer park when he heard where he was from (he's never lived in a trailer). So immediately not a good impression. 
We get seated, the manager tells us our server is going to be male, a female shows up. Clearly bad communication. The waitress greets us and asks how we're doing and I return the question. She responds that she has been better. I'm a server and I know from experience, even if you're having a bad day, you don't show it or just come right out and say it. 
The waitress suggests homemade hurricanes to drink. Two of the people in my party decide to try one. They were horrible. They were so potent u could hardly drink them. They definitely needed to add a little juice. Some cornbread with a honey sauce came to the table. It was very good! As an appetizer, the 4 of us split a sampler platter.... Which took 25 minutes to hit the table. The shrimp were good. The catfish was plain. The salmon patties were just OK. The red beans were pretty good. The turnip greens were very bitter. Overall not impressed. 
For our entrees: One friend got the rib eye, it was undercooked. His wife got a blackened fish. The only reason the fish was ""blackened"" was because it was burnt. My fiancé got the jambalaya and catfish plate. The jambalaya was decent but the catfish was again plain. I had the shrimp scampi. It was pretty much the only positive thing about the whole meal besides the cornbread. Oh and did I mention it took 45 minutes after we finished our appetizer for the entrees to get there...",-1
"Asked for a trim and thinning out, got butchered instead! The ladies were rude to start I should've walked out but I didn't now we will suffer 6 months while this mullet grows out!",-1
"First off all the really good local restaurants are closed on Sunday nights so we ended up in the tourist trap water front area for dinner. Went to Oliver's with a party of 8. We had a variety of entrees from the menu and all I can say is for $40 per person (total bill including the already added 18% gratuity and tax and a $40 bottle of wine) what a disappointment. Took 45 min to get our food, and of the 6 different dishes only 1 had any real flavor (ravioli). If you're looking for bland and slow close to the quarter this is the place to go.",-1
"This place has gone way downhill. Used to be my favorite sushi place in the St Louis area and now I wouldn't recommend it at all (as much as I would in the past that is disappointing). The happy hour menu no longer has much to choose from, almost to where it's not worth going out of your way for it. The most consistent part of this place is how inconsistent it is. Each time I go in there the rolls are different. The worst part about it is that they have gotten worse with each iteration. This time the seaweed was rolled to where a pencil would fit through and nothing larger. I'm definitely still hungry after spending a good chunk of change. Sorry to say this has been my last time.",-1
"I don't think my husband and I ordered the right things.  I had the vegetarian pasta and he had the chicken smothered in cheese.  The pasta was good, I just did not like the sauce it came in because it was kind of bland.  My husband said his chicken was dry.  The best part of the meal was the salad that came with it, have the garlic dressing, it was amazing.  I think as long as you get the specials of the house you will be happy.",1
"All I can say is wow...I expected a lot more from this place.  The waiter was sub-par to say the least.  I think in the 2 hours we were there, we saw our waiter three times maybe?  The food for some was hot, but for some, was luke warm, because instead of delivering the food as it was done, they waited to deliver all of our food together.  Mushroom Ravioli with short rib meat underneath that is luke warm is NOT good eats.  The waiter never asked if we wanted dessert afterward either, just brought our check that had a pre-determined 21 pretentious tipping included in it.  We didn't have a group of 30 people, and with the fact that our waiter was almost non-exsistant, was a tip that was not well earned nor deserved.  Attention to detail and customer service should match the price tag of this place, which was way overpriced for what you get. Because it's attached to the Marriot hotel chain, you'd think that the food and the service would be much higher scale to match the price tag of the food, but evidently they missed the bus on that one...",1
"A group of six went to The Block a little over five years ago and none of us enjoyed our meal. The amount of salt ruined everything. We knew we wouldn't be going back.
Over the years, I was told by a number of people how much they liked this place. My husband and I decided to try it again. We thought maybe we had been there on a bad night or perhaps there was a new chef.
Four of us went this past Sunday. The Ale and Smoked cheddar was good - a good melted cheese with house made pretzels. I found the House-Made Bacon Jam to be too salty, but the other three liked it.
Our server said the pork chop, the pork and dumplings, and the white wine braised pork were the three most popular entrees. I, fortunately, ordered the burger. The burger was nothing special, but it was fine. I couldn't eat the fries due to the amount of salt on them. My fingers were literally covered in salt after picking up a few fries.
One person ordered the white wine braised pork and said it was a little too salty and just didn't taste good. She did like the potatoes and carrots that came with the pork.
The other two ordered the pork and dumplings. One ate about a quarter of it and the other a little less than half. It was so salty they couldn't eat any more
A person, who I believe may have been a manager, came by to see how everything was and we told her. She said most of the spices they use contain salt. She then offered to have different entrees made which we declined - we'd already been there for a little while. They did take one of the orders of pork and dumplings off the bill.
Since there wasn't a lot of dinner consumed, we did order some ice cream which was just okay. And the salted caramel was, you guessed it, too salty!
I honestly don't know how people can eat the food here. It's truly the saltiest food I've ever had. That much salt can't be good for anybody! We definitely won't be going back.",-1
Both times we have come to this location the service is remarkably slow during non peak hours. the employees don't seem to listen when we order. For example I had to tell one person my order 3 times and when I repeated myself they seemed like I was imposing on them. The food is standard for Wendy's but the customer service is terrible. I won't go back which is rather unfortunate because it's just down the street.,-1
"In short, save your money, people! The website hasn't been updated in I don't know how long. The name has even changed. I'm surprised I even found it. I think it's Smuggles or Snuggles, something like that. I ordered the BBQ wings and a Deluxe 14"" pizza, extra mozzarella cheese . ($27 and change) Wings were awful, overcooked and I've never tasted a BBQ sauce like they used. The girl that took my money didn't even give me back my change. Pizza is cut in aquares, like Imos and the bacon was laid on top . I mean strips of bacon, no cut up bacon. Pizza was ok, taste wise, which is the only positive thing I can say about this place. There was no extra mozzarella cheese on it. If you go to pick up your pizza and it's after 10pm, wear ear plugs before going in.",-1
"We went here, on advice from a newspaper review.  What a disappointment!  The bread was like Wonder Bread, with a dipping ""marinara"" that was red just like sauce straight from a can, no simmering! The food all lacked flavor, and that is being very kind & considerate!",-1
"I've been here several times and it was always OK. This past time was definitely something to share.

It took around 15 minutes to get a booth even though there were plenty of free tables...they could have at least sat us and brought us some coffee! After we placed our order the food arrived pretty quickly. There was only one problem though...the waitress brought out a bowl of soup with her thumb stuck half way into it.  That's disgusting! Make that two problems...My breakfast skillet wasn't even close to being hot. It seemed like they just took it out of the fridge and heated it in a microwave for 30 seconds. No bueno. 

The coffee has always been bad, but it was at a new level. It pretty much tasted like hot dirty water--not a pleasant way to wake up in the morning. 

As if this wasn't enough to ruin the experience, we encountered one last problem. When we were ready to leave our check was nowhere to be found. Our waitress had been outside on a smoke break for 10 minutes so we went up front to pay. Nobody in the whole place had our ticket so we had to wait another 10 just to get a new one. 

Obviously it was a major let down--and I will definitely never go back. It's a shame too because it is a great location and has the potential to be a famous diner. They definitely have their work cut out for them though.",-1
Came here on a Saturday night it was just ok. The bouncers were rude at the door but the bartenders and receptionist were nice. It was almost empty and nobody was dancing it was awkward. We ended up leaving and going to another spot.,1
"This place's posted hours include a 10PM closing time. 

I walked in at 8:30 and, as soon as I got to the counter, the guy said to me ""kitchen's closed."" The grill, fryers, etc were all being covered up. 

First of all, if your kitchen is closed, why is the door to your restaurant unlocked? 

Secondly, I could see this being the case if I walked in at, say, 9:55PM. But 8:30? That's ridiculous.",-1
"The ride is quite boring but you'll learn about depth of water and the history of the boat and the city around just from listening to the operator talk.  The bars weren't fancy but it will do the trick.  It's the touristy thing to do and you should do it just because you're here and you might not get to do it the next time you're in town.  I suggest you do the lunch time tours rather than the night time ones because you'll get to see more of the scenery.  There isn't much to see when its pitch dark outside. 

Pros: You're a tourist, you like touristy things, take this trip.

Cons: Boring.  But not quite a total waste of time.  I used this trip to recover from my hangover from drinking way too much the night before.",1
"SUB-PAR
Let's be clear: this hotel is in a great location, is attractively decorated, with friendly staff.  However, for a hotel advertised alongside better-known premium hotels (e.g., Ritz-Carlton, Omni), this was a disappointment, most notably in the quality of service.  Clearly not worth the rack rate or as much as neighboring hotels in this class.

1.  Maintenance problems.  When I arrived, I was initially assigned a room whose door did not close.

2.  Understaffed/poorly trained.  The front desk staff said he would send someone to evaluate the above problem.  After an hour of waiting and repeated calls to the front desk, nobody showed. I re-packed my belongings and had to go back to the front desk to request a room re-assignment.  The staff told me, ""Sorry, we're having a problem with our engineer."" I wish they had just re-assigned me without wasting my time.  I missed the events I planned to attend that night.

3.  Unhelpful staff.  I asked to extend my reservation (made through an online bid) one day, and the staff told me I would need to (a) move rooms and (b) pay the rack rate.  I made another online bid and thankfully moved to another premium hotel, at a lower price than my bid for The Saint.

4.  Lacks amenities.  This is one of the very few hotels in the area that considers itself premium but lacks a pool, hot tub, or spa.  Additionally, while other hotels in the class typically have a doorman, this one never did.

During my stay, I relayed these comments to the hotel guest relations staff. Per an emailed auto-reply, she was attending a training conference (and thus could not address my concerns).

I did like the blue hallway lighting, flat-panel TVs, free wifi, pod coffee makers.  I stayed 4 nights in April 2012.  ",-1
"My date and I popped in to Los Jefes for a late afternoon lunch recently, hoping that this colorful Mexican joint would be a new addition to our taco and fajita rotation.  Our hopes were dashed after a less than stellar experience.

My main beef is regarding the service.  Although the place was not that busy, it took forever to  1.) be greeted, 2.) to receive our drinks, 3.) to have our orders taken and 4.) to receive refills of chips and salsa.  The drinks we ordered were just the basic house frozen margaritas, nothing special or extra, literally comes out of a daiquiri machine.  On top of all that, our orders did not arrive both at once.  This is a huge pet peeve for me when dining out because it feels rude to me to start digging into my meal when others at my table are still waiting on their food.  

I was hoping that the food and drinks would excuse the poor service, but honestly, I've had better elsewhere.  It's awesome that you get a free order of queso when checking in with the Yelp app, but it came out cold!  The redfish tacos were tasty enough, but for the price, I wish there could have been more fish.  The margaritas were okay, but again, I've had better at other restaurants.

If a restaurant is going to earn a return visit from me, it needs to be consistent on both it's service and food.  Los Jefes gave me neither.  On a side note, the owner stopped by our table and thanks us for dining there, which was cool.  Unfortunately, this gesture is not enough for me to eat here again.",-1
"Bad experience in every way! Kept me waiting for no apparent reason, wasn't nice at all and did a terrible job on my brows. Aside from feeling scalped I am also uneven. All this for top dollar. Never again.",-1
"Made an appointment on line at 12:30 on a Sunday for 2 pm They claim they do same day service. Ride up there and am told ""it's better to call because then they can see if the guys who do diagnostics are in."" They were not there. Really? I posted in the appointment comments what the problem was (why not notify me you can't do the work before I drive there in a car that may brake down) and what mechanic can't run a diagnostic? Doesn't the machine do it for you? Clowns and jokers  Stay away. Lying lumps of crap.",-1
"I've stopped here a few times for papers and small stuff. Their location is convenient, but the staff is rude and the items are very over priced. I go to Frolic for any substantial purchases, it's worth the extra drive.",-1
"We came in for dinner with my parents.  Unfortunately, where we were seated it was rather dark. It was difficult to read the menu.  The pizza was hot but the crust lacked flavor and was very greasy.  We had to flag down the server to ask for refills and the night was not busy.",-1
"Love this place with the vibrant colors on a Sunday morning after a night out! We loved the Bloody Mary bar, however they were out of almost everything and they didn't replace. Our waitress was not with it. We have 8 people and it was about a 2 hour trip, 30 min of that was her just trying to figure out the bills, credit cards and payments. It was bad.",-1
"I called the other night with some laminating questions. The guy who answered the phone was super upbeat and actually seemed happy to help me. My call was transferred to the print center and lo & behold, that guy was just as happy to help me too! 

I wanted to write this review right then and there because I was so impressed but thought I should wait, just in case. But alas, I was not let down. I got all my stuff laminated in less than 10 minutes and the customer service was again, spectacular!",1
"Worst customer service I have encountered here... Was lied to not once but 3 times about a taxi being ""on the way"" 2 hours later after I'm home I get a call saying the taxi is outside. Comical. Never calling again.",-1
"Very busy place, with a nice out door waiting area, ordered red sangria and honestly it sucked who puts cinnamon in  sangria and if that's common they put way to much,  basicly it was crap wine with cinnamon in it, on a better not the crab guacamole was amazing, super fresh and a nice amount of crab inside, we also had shrimp/crab  empenada's very good..... I had the carne asada, was cooked very well but sauce was bland as well as the rice, mom had a steak dish that had way to much cumin in it, horrible overwhelming spice that was all you could taste. Atmosphere is nice with the exception of every guy wearing a dry fit shirt and  cargo shorts. Wait staff was professional and quick to serve. I guess I would try it again to get a better experience",1
"Normally this Hardees is quite good and the manager is wonderful. He is always friendly and helpful and hard working.  he food is usually good and fast.These morons they had working yesterday were awful. They must be new or just have no business working in""fast food"". They took like twenty minutes to help each customer then got the orders wrong,then didnt even apologize to anyone for their mistakes. You could tell they didnt care at all.",-1
"This has been an awful experience. We walked in around 1:30 pm and we waited for our drinks for 40 minutes and had to remind the waiter three times. Half of our table received their meals while the other half had to wait an extra 20 minutes. There were two tables here and a few at the bar, not busy at all. The table behind us walked out due to the awful service, and I'm currently wondering why I didn't. never going back",-1
"DO NOT GET LASER HAIR REMOVAL DONE HERE!!! I purchased a Groupon for 6 sessions and 8 sessions later barely saw any results. Keep in mind that I am a perfect candidate for laser having fair to medium skin tone and dark hair.  The staff's reaction to my concern/frustration was ""well everyone is different"" and that they would do an ""in house Groupon"" if I wanted to buy another package. Why would I waste more money on something that didn't work in the 1st place?? I should also mention that I'm not the only person who did not have good results, a friend of mine had the exact same experience at Co Capelli.  I'm not sure if their laser is bad or if the people administering it just don't know what they're doing, but I didn't show up for my 9th appointment (I would have had to purchase more sessions-NO THANKS). Funny thing is that nobody even bothered to call and ask if I needed to reschedule, which you would think is pretty standard when you miss an appointment. 

However, there is a silver lining to all of this. The Groupon gods must have taken pity on me and an offer popped up recently for  Hairfree Nashville, a place that actually SPECIALIZES in hair removal  (it was even $10 cheaper than what I originally paid at Co Capelli). I was hesitant but decided to give it a try and WOW...amazing results after the 1st session. These people are REAL professionals (not some girls who decided they needed a break from cutting hair and wanted to play around with a laser). I didn't realize how awful Co Capelli actually was until I experienced Hairfree Nashville. The space is lovely and does not reek of salon chemicals which is an added bonus, and the staff is VERY knowledgeable about the process of hair removal. The laser itself is 1000 times better and blows a cool stream of air so it was MUCH less painful. I was also given real goggles to shield my eyes that fit like sunglasses, not the uncomfortable metal tanning bed goggles that mess up your eye makeup which Co Capelli for some reason has opted to use. 

Bottom line- if you are seriously considering investing the time and money for hair removal please do not make the same mistake I did. Go to a place that actually specializes in laser like Hairfree Nashville. You will not be disappointed!",-1
"My girlfriend and I decided to try Kalamata's last night at around 7:30. The guy at the counter asked us if we're ready to order even before we had the chance to look at the menu properly, not once but multiple times. 

We ordered 2 lamb gyros, a side order of roasted potatoes and the tabouleh. The potatoes came out extremely fast and were lukewarm at best. Either they were premade, and ""microwaved to order"" or were just sitting on a hot plate. Not something I'd expect from any restaurant. 

The tabouleh was SOUR - like salad dunked in a bottle of fish sauce sour. We decided to tell the guy upfront our issues with the tabouleh but all we got out of him was ""This is our recipe. This is the way we make it. It's fine if you don't like it, but this is how we make it"". I agree I have no idea what authentic tabouleh tastes like, or how to make it, but I have tasted GOOD tabouleh in the past, and this was far from it. I pity the people who've eaten tabouleh only at this establishment because they're really missing out. 

The gyros were pedestrian at best, under-seasoned and most of all under-sauced. The veggies were on one side of the pita, the meat on the other - so you'd never get a mouthful of veggies+meat and only one side of the pocket had the sauce. Suspecting another ""This is how we sauce our gyros. This is our recipe"" moment, we decided to finish our food ASAP.

Finally, the worst offense was that the guy starts closing up shop while we're still eating. Really? I've no idea how this place got 4 stars on yelp, but there are way better restaurants in Nashville for Mediterranean food.",-1
"Came down from Jersey after seeing the Dan Band perform, which was phenomenal! We got the urge to order a hookah with a liquor option. Walked over to Fez.. no one attended us at first so we sat down at the couch area. The place was dead for 10pm Friday. 

The attendant came and said let me seat you someplace else. I asked to keep the seat I was already at. He said we couldn't, so I told him to speak to whomever to get the approval. The guy came out and ask what's the problem. I said hey boss, your place is dead and we'd like to sit at the large couch area. He said they can't because that's for parties of 8. I said I understand, but there was no one in your store and if that big party ever came, we would move. Their answer: no we can't. 

I said no problem, packed my things and was ready to walk out. The guy asked are you really leaving? I said bro, no one is here. The place is dead. What do I have to do? Order a bottle? He said no again.. so.. went to a better spot! Saqqara Hookah bear broad across from City Diner! So much better staff! No young deutche bags trying to show how much more testosterone they have.

Saqqara had great fast hookah service, really really great food and best part, was their service. They actually made the effort to cater to their guest. 

Fez.. you are the old 2017. Do better 2018! Saqqara, keep up the great work! You'll squash the competition in no time!",1
"Been coming here with my brother for 10 years and will continue to come here for many more I hope. Get a players card, it's free, and they don't care how much money you play with just how long you play. If you have a card you will get amazing comps like free rooms and dining discounts. After their 500 million dollar expansion they really are the best hotel in Reno and it's a nice distance from downtown where now it's become ghetto. Great staff, service, food, drinks, and entertainment. 5 stars all the way!",1
"This store was such a huge disappointment. We are new to Arizona, and I was excited to visit due to the great reviews. I went in search of kitschy SW décor, and I couldn't stay long. The entire store reeked of urine. It was more than my poor nose could handle.",-1
"The good is that these were seriously good burgers--the meat was fresh and the buns were soft and tasty

The only issues were that I called the order in and it took more than 30 minutes for it to be done--when I got it home, the bacon cheeseburger that I ordered ""plain"" as ""only meat, bread and cheese--no condiments or veggies"" had the mustard spread in the bread.

So next time I will give them more time to cook and double check the order before I leave--it was really good other than that.",1
"So we walk in and the receptionist Vann was 
 absolutely incompetent at his job,  we simply asked if there was any vacancy to which he replied with out any computer or paperwork check ""NO""

so we walk out and do a online search and booked a room to that same hotel!

We Came back confronted him about it to which he replied ""he didn't know anything about it"" 

Well Van if you don't know the only thing you are being paid to do, I suggest a you find a new profession.",-1
"We encountered a short wait but were called in about10 minutes. We ordered garlic clams, clam chowder, fresh oysters and the crab sandwich. Got photos of most, except the crab sandwich as it was soooo delicious it was gone before I managed to take a photo!

Service is ok but super casual. 

Great fresh seafood. Yum.",1
"I'm very happy with the food, and most of all the service.

I ordered biscuits and gravy and was not happy with what came to the table, the server quickly fixed it and even the manager came out to apologize.

You can tell everyone cares.",1
"Go here and get a burger.  Get the King Burger and the Village Whiskey Burger.  Also get some pickles and eat your face off.  I like going here and just stuffing my face and enjoying every minute of it.  From the duck fries to the deviled eggs - order, eat, and enjoy.  Just go and eat and savor.  Yeah your gonna pay but it is worth it.",1
"I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for Pi before now because we have been there a few times.  This time we took my sister-n-law and her boyfriend who had been visiting us from England.  I shared a deep dish and my wife and her sister shared a thin crust.  All of us really enjoyed the pizzas of our choosing.  That is a great thing about Pi.  You can pick whatever style you want and also pick any pizza on their menu for your half. It makes sharing so easy!  
We were able to enjoy our pizzas outside on the sidewalk which made it even better.  The only problem was our waiter.  Not that he was a bad waiter, he just seemed to be trying to hard to be some type of character.  He also kept telling us how busy he was when he clearly was not.  
To me, Pi is St Louis' hometown pizza place.  (Not an Imo's fan! Provel???)",1
"Used to come here while on business to the city. Dive bars are hip. Not this one. This one is just a mess. Bugs, I mean COCKROACHES, crawl along the bar and into people's coats (I overheard). I have seen the roaches and had a few crawl onto my hand. In the men's bathroom there's just a trash bag taped on the wall where a urinal used to be. 
I have also overheard that 3 female employees have quit. Which makes it seem like it's not a safe place for ladies. 
The bartender I encountered seemed very overwhelmed and perturbed with serving customers that weren't  friends and that weren't doing shots of cheap liquor. Bartender was also playing obnoxious hip hop too loud and denied access to the jukebox that clearly was just paused, not ""broken"", like he poorly tried to explain. I believe ownership or management changed since the last time I visited. Definitely not what it used to be.",-1
"I had no idea what I was stepping into when I walked in. The restaurant has closed rooms rather than being open concept. It looked so small at first! But if you come with a large enough party, maybe you'll be able to get a room for yourselves. The restaurant has a pioneer hunter-Native American history kind of feel. It was enough to make me feel like I went back in time. They also have real fire places throughout the restaurants, which I enjoyed.

The restaurant is known for featuring game animals on their menu. I went at dinner time, and they had wild boar, venison, and rabbit. The dinner menu also featured fish, chicken, pork chop steaks, lamb, and ribs. I had the rabbit, which I thought was okay. They took the meat off the bones and prepared it in a way to make ""scallions."" It was kind of tough and hard to chew. I have had better rabbit at other restaurants. I had a bite of the venison, and it was delicious. It didn't have a gamey taste, so don't be afraid to try it! Dinner also comes with a basked of bread, salad, chili, or soup of the day. 

The staff was friendly and honest. When asking about the menu, the lady who took our order told us her favorites, what was popular, and which meals were smaller compared to others. 

Warning: For those who have their smartphones surgically attached to their hand, you do not get service out here.",1
"Four stars for the comfy recliners. Didn't order any food. First showing will cost $10 per ticket, $12 per ticket all other shows. 

There was a real bad sewage smell near the kitchen that made me decide not to order food. They had just opened up and only 8 people in theater. Guess they need to advertise. 

Looked at the menu and typical prices for food at a movie. Different from cinebistro as they allow kids before 6pm. $5 beer and $4 bottled water. Go figure!!  Website said $6 popcorn but menu says $7. Strange that they raised price. Didn't they just open?  Anyway it's closer than cinebistro so I'm glad for that. Also glad we went to see action packed Man of Steel or I could have easily zonked out.  ",-1
"Food is good, however if your attitude stinks I refuse to give you a good review. We've been here before while visiting PHilly we were in Delaware and decided to drive to Philly. Only to be greeted by someone who appeared to be having a bad start to the new year. Hope you have a great new year.",-1
"Not bad. Prices are very reasonable, service is friendly. This place works like a subway: you go in, pick a size and start adding ingredients which you can see. Sizes are deceiving and pack more of a punch than you'd think, based on just looking at them. That being said, a large bowl may or may not be enough for a hungry person, and the lack of additional sides or other items to quench your appetite may leave you either ordering another bowl, or seeking munchies elsewhere.",1
"The lady at the front desk was amazing, we got in at 3am and she found us a room. The problem I have is we were trying to get into our room when somebody walked out and said they worked there and said that's where he takes his breaks because ""nobody ever books this room."" This was very weird and uncomfortable, and then when we walked in the room smelled awful.",-1
"I used to love to go to this place back in the late 1980s when it was on Pine Street. Then it was a great place for brunch and ice cream. When I took my children to the current location a few weeks ago, we had small ice cream cones that were over-priced and the staff was not terribly helpful. The person who waited on me left my receipt with credit card info. sitting on the counter while she disappeared outside to pick up lunch down the street. However, the real turn-off is the price. Go to Franklin Fountain instead! They have a better selection at more reasonable prices in a more attractive setting.",-1
"If you're going to eat at an izakaya joint, you should be a somewhat adventurous eater.  That being said, I found nothing adventurous about the menu at Izayaka Ren.

I was so excited to hear that St. Louis was finally getting an izakaya restaurant.  But after eating there last weekend, I'm so disappointed.

First off, there are only about 4 different sakes on the menu.  All those 30+ bottles on the shelves in the bar?  Those are for ""display only,"" we were told.  

The agedashi tofu was drowning in broth.  I ordered ""agedashi tofu,"" not ""agedashi tofu soup.""

The vegetable croquettes would be better as smaller, silver-dollar size bites.  Not pancake size.

They were out of onigiri.  ...which is just a rice ball, grilled.  So, um, why would a izakaya/sushi place be OUT of rice?

We sat at the sushi bar and saw many rolls off to the side already pre-made.  We imagine many of the cooked items we ordered we pre-made as well.  (As was probably the ""sold out' onigiri.)  I imagine the raw scallops were wrapped in bacon and kept in the fridge days ago instead of being made fresh.

The skewered scallops wrapped in bacon were fine - but anything wrapped in bacon is usually fine.  With that in mind, bacon wrapped mochi is divine and I highly suggest this restaurant start serving that.  Made fresh to order.

The fried squid we ordered was tasty, but really greasy.

Don't bother ordering the skewered quail eggs wrapped in prosciutto.  They're nothing to write home about.

Also, we saw the cooks grilling chicken on a grill that had fishy mackerel grilling on it moments prior.  ...i.e, that chicken's going to taste awfully fishy.

Waitstaff needs help.  First, our waitress greeted us with ""do you want waters or sodas?""  Not, ""hello.""  Not even, ""may I get you something to drink?""  Waitstaff also needs to stop entering for their shift through the front door.  It doesn't look professional.  They should arrive through the backdoor.  

My suggestions for the owners:  Polish up your staff, create a more adventurous menu (takoyaki would be a nice start), have later hours, offer a much MUCH larger selection of sake, lay off the tired sushi items, and make things fresh to order.  Make it more of an izakaya sake BAR with good food, not some average west county sushi restaurant.

My suggestions for potential patrons:  Expand your pallette beyond California rolls and tempura.  Also, don't bother coming here until the owners change some things.  Also, stop calling it ""tapas"" for christsake.",-1
"We ran in for a late night dinner last night. The prices are definitely high. Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure.
I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread. 

Overall - I probably wouldn't eat there again myself. But it could have been an off night. There is just too much competition in the food world around St Louis!",1
Not letting us split the check and also only one bowl rice each table and if we want extra need to play for it and bad service,-1
don't order the chips they're awful! I told our waitress they were stale and she was very nice but said that everyone thinks they're stale but that's just the chips they use.,-1
If I could post -1 stars I would! I mistakenly brought my 13 year old son and his friend here and didn't look around enough before paying .. I kid you not the bumper car area is as big as a 1 car garage.. They basically only had room to spin in circles.  the blow up slide reminds me of the smaller version of what you can rent for your back yard. They only have 10 arcade games.. Everyone including the parent has to pay to play.. The food is not even up to par with Chuck E Cheese. the staff is rude. My best advice is keep your coins in your pocket.,-1
"What a weird experience. Menu looked great online. When we got there, noticed a guitarist was playing, which was nice. We were seated up front, away from the music, but it would've been nice if they had asked where we wanted to be since there was live music available. The hostess and buspeople were very nice and chatted us up. Our waiter, Kyle, must've been having an off day. He was nice, but just not quite on the ball. The bf ordered orange juice - it was watered down, obviously so. I wasn't listening when he ordered, and by the color and taste, I guessed it was grapefruit. Yeah, it was yellow, not orange. When we pointed it out to the waiter, he didn't seem surprised in the least, and then brought us actual orange juice, complete with pulp and no ice, the complete opposite of the last glass, which was yellow, had no pulp, and iced down. NOT a good start... We placed our order, and I ordered coffee also. I told him I'd need alot of cream and sugar. No kidding, he brought 2 packets. Awkward, so then I had to repeat myself, please bring more... I had to wave him down each time I wanted a refill. He did check on us after we received our order which was nice.

The food was amazing! The stuffed french toast was sandwiched together with cream cheese, coated with a generous serving of pistachios, and sprinkled with carmel. Yum! My eggs had cream cheese, toast, and crispy potatoes with veggies and a side of fruit. The bf had a giant! delicious omelet w goat cheese and the same sides. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the food - 5 stars all around.

As the meal went on, noticed many sets of patrons coming from the back, all white, while my party and another black couple and a party of 2 older white women we eating up front. You might think, oh, they didn't have space... But they did, the second room was full of empty tables, and brunch ended 1 hr after we arrived. From what I overheard, Kyle messed up the other black couple's order too...But either the kitchen manager or chef came out to check on them and see if they wanted a substition, which was nice. The owner or manager Nathalie, I'm guessing, came by and greeted all the other parties (including the black couple), didn't say a peep to me. Yeah, I really hate exclusionary practices, and going to a restaurant and getting worse treatment than other people, it's just no good.This place just didn't have a warm, welcoming vibe, just seemed cold. Must be the ghost of Salt past.",1
"sam's is great.  sam is great.  the sushi is pretty good, and it's super cheap.

go in, grab a drink from the cooler, and don't speak/order until spoken to.  don't go in with any group bigger than 4.  don't walk in at 9pm (closing time).  sam will get angry if you try to tip him... 

follow those rules and sam won't kick you out.  everyone who said the service sucked broke at least one of those rules--i'm almost sure of it.",1
"My Room was disgusting. The odor when I walked in was terrible. They had put a very large air filter in the living room to try and mask the smell. The carpet looks as if it was molding in the bedroom against the wall - looks to be the shower wall. Must have leaked.  No iron had to call in am and wait. Oh btw when I called to have someone come up and check the room and the smell they never came - nice!  You know Mgmt knows about the issues and are avoiding them. I'm a Hilton and Marriott frequent guest for business. Man this makes me not want to give Hilton my business. Starwood is now going to move up a notch as  top two property to stay at. 

Oh the power went out in the hotel at 6 am ish. Not their fault as the waffle house next door had it power off too. It was freaky though to wake up in pitch black. Thank god for iPhone flashlight app!!!",1
"I was also a little dismay that a couple of truck ran out of food around 7:45pm. Less than an hour after the event started. These truck vendor must not watch Tyler Florence's The Great Food Truck Race, the supermarket is only a block away people. Go restock and cook again, there's money to be made here and tons of people lining up for food. 

Other than that though, the event is pretty much a success since there were so many people coming out. I think next time there should at least be people selling other artifacts like candles or specialty food items. I was glad for the music and the liveliness, I was glad for an event happening in the middle of a boring week. The oxtail stew and potato salad I got was wonderful, so is the fried fish sandwich. It's disappointing that all the taco truck ran out of food so early, but be sure that I will be there again next time an event like this occur.",1
"Though top notch service is demanded at a JW, I was thoroughly impressed with the property, service, and staff. 

I only had two complaints. One was the noise level as there was an outdoor concert until 11pm. The other was the below average bartender at velocity during lunch. Nothing terrible, but lacked enthusiasm and desire to give good service. Obviously the concert wasn't the hotel's fault. The bartender issue wasn't worth dropping the rating a star. 

Overall, the GM of the hotel seems as though he/she has it together. Thanks to all the staff for a nice stay.",1
"I'm all about ice cream, really I am. But it was early and I wanted a hot chocolate. The problem is that I'm a hot chocolate snob. Only milk, only dark, whip cream? yes please. So I asked around and got a couple of recommendations from locals and was not disappointed. This is a first for me. I went to an ice cream joint and didn't get ice cream! So think of Mike's as an ice cream joint with a top quality coffee shop inside and you'll be right on.",-1
"I think this place is the bees knees. Their food is inventive and wildly tasty, the atmosphere is super cool and casual. Cheu is a bright spot in the neighborhood and started to become my go-to though I haven't been back in a while. Last time I was in, I ordered a bowl of ramen and a Sapporo after a particularly long day at work. The purple-haired waitress dropped the bowl in front of me, I thanked her and then as I shoveled noodles into my face and tuned into a book, I heard her talking some shit about me to her coworker. As a tenured service industry employee, I completely get venting about work or even about customers who are jerks but since I was minding my own business and close enough to hear her rag on me, I was perplexed. Then, when another man came in, angling for my seat, the same server looked at my full beer and half full bowl and told him that I'd be leaving shortly which was glaringly inaccurate and made me feel super rushed. It is highly likely that this woman is a lovely human being and was just having a bad day but the random meanness hurt my feelings and made me a little gun shy about going back despite the killer food stuffs.",-1
"Hickory Hollow really isn't that bad. If you don't count that shooting earlier this year that is. I'm being serious here. I really don't think the area is all that bad, so I don't know if it is just fear that keeps people from frequenting here or what. It could soon be because of lack of stores, several have closed shop within the last year. 

They have I'd say a 50/50 split in stores like New York & Company to get work clothes and urban stores. As far as I know right now, they still have a Victoria's Secret and Waldenbooks, what more could a dorky girl want in a mall right? Because of the low attendance you'll have no problem finding sales. It's really sad to think this place may be heading in the direction of other malls in the city.",-1
"Disappointing
I've been to the location on Park near University several times, and been very please every time. Today I decided to try this location, and am now regretting my decision. 
I ordered my usual BBQ chicken chop salad, but what I got was not the usual. Dressing was served on the side in a half-full micro container, which even if full would not have been enough. The University location mixed the dressing for you, or at least offered to, which made the salad in my opinion. What I got was an over-priced, wilted, tasteless salad . it was so boring. Even the dressing and chicken itself were different than what they have at the Park location! It just was not what I expected. I'd recommend making the effort to go to the Park & University location, even if parking on university is annoying!",-1
Bread tasted old and was dry. Beef had no flavor and there was hardly any provolone. This is a big disappointment and will definitely hurt the brand name over this airport excuse.,-1
"I have been to this nail salon a few times over the past 3 mos. Their quality and service is slipping. This is too bad because I go here because it is so close to my work and easy for me to pop in on my way home. 

It is still clean, friendly service, etc. No complaints there. But the quality of service is not as good. They are not as thorough and services have been rushed and sloppy. 

One complaint is there is only one employee who does nails (other than manis) and this is a huge time suck. 

Another is that my last pedi was rushed and not up to par. The woman did not trim the cuticles as well, remove dead skin, pay attention to detail, or do a thorough job. She went very fast and cut corners.

I got a full set, and a pedi. The man did the nails (which were fine/good except for some acrylic on the sides which he fixed later) and then she painted them. The polish job was sloppy. I had bare spots on the edges, lumps (old polish?) and overspill onto the sides and cuticles. She did not follow up with polish remover to clean them up - instead, as she painted, she ran her nail along the edges to remove it. Not quality. 

I happen to like nail art once in a while - not every time - but sometimes I splurge. There does not seem to be anyone who does nail art well. There are many designs you can choose from on the hand models/boards but they are not recreated well. I chose one design for my big toes and it looked nothing like what I picked out. On an earlier visit, I had a picture of a design on my phone and was told point blank they couldn't do it - it was not complicated or too fancy. ??? I have witnessed other customers being disappointed in the nail art feature as well. 

Overall, I think this place may be understaffed to meet demand and is struggling with consistent quality. They need another person who can do nails really well like the man does and they need to take their time/provide thorough service.",-1
"Oh yes. But oh no. Perhaps I shouldn't have gone here on Cinco De Mayo as my first attempt at La Rev, but at least I went in with the expectation of mayhem.

They had to shut down the bar for a while to catch up on orders. That's how backed up it got. But honestly? I didn't mind!

With a huge open air tiki patio and 85 degree weather, who could complain? They even brought us free chips and queso to apologize for the lengthy wait. 

The food was good, the drinks were good, he scenery was good... It was all good!",1
"Best pizza ever
Worst service tho

I still keep coming because the pizza is still go but be ready to wait a hour or more and to wait in a long line for a refil of soda 

On a slow night it's awesome no complaints",-1
"Went there yesterday (Oct 25) at about 4:00 PM. Had the nitro and it was delicious, hence earning the two stars.

However, like *many* other reviewers here, the service is awful. Not only were we an apparent nuisance to the baristas reviewing Halloween costumes with their (boy)friends, but also were treated with, as one other customer said, much shade.

I brought my own cup in which to have my coffee. However, when I asked if she could put the drink in my cup, I received elevator eyes, a smirk, and a clear, ""No"". Ok, I thought, sometimes sizes are difficult to estimate in a different cup.

Then, as we were sitting down enjoying our coffees, I turned around to look at the counter for WiFi info. I received a stern look from the barista, who then exclaimed ""Can I hep you with something?"", to which I responded, ""oh, I was just looking if you had WiFi."" The barista responded, ""We have a sign, for you,"" again with a plethora of shade.

Will never return, thanks for trying.",-1
"I really want to love this place, but they make it so hard. The past three times in a row I've been there, there has been some sort of ridiculous customer service issue that left me and whoever I was with super annoyed.

Starting with the good: the coffee is delicious. The assortment of baked goods is great...quiche is yummy, etc. I've always loved the space...good mixture of comfy couches and real seating where people can sit and work on laptops. Plenty of outdoor seating on nice days.

The prices are...steep. BUT I always feel good about supporting a local small business, so whatever. My real problem is the 'tude and just general lack of professionalism that I've seen from the baristas. They clearly know their coffee, and that's great, but here are some of the more ridiculous things that have happened to me there in the past month:

--purchased coffee with my mom and went to add our cream and sugar. My mom realized the half and half container was empty and gave the guy behind the counter a head's up. His answer: ""Yeah, we're actually out of half and half."" Everyone stared blankly at him, including the other people in line. Now mind you, it was before noon, not five minutes before they closed. No apology, no ""I'm so sorry, we sent someone down the street to the 7-11 (literally down the street) to pick some up, they should be back any minute."" That was it. The guy behind us asked, ""is anyone going to get some more?"" and the kid literally shrugged his shoulders and turned his back to us. Ummmmmm. As my mom said, when you charge people $8 for two coffees (one of which was just a drip coffee), I don't think it's too much to ask that you provide HALF AND HALF AT YOUR COFFEE SHOP. 

--another time I was there, a friend asked for her coffee extra hot, and then when it arrived just warm, she asked if they could nuke it in the microwave for a minute. She was very nice about it. The girl behind the counter, on the other hand, felt it necessary to explain in a condescending tone for five minutes that they ""actually can't put the coffee cups in the microwave"" for some reason I now forget, and then reluctantly offered to add some hot water. Uhhhh. Homegirl. Could you maybe just take the coffee and solve the problem? Put it in a to go cup and microwave it? This doesn't seem like THAT hard of a problem to solve, nor can I imagine it's the first time someone has asked for their coffee extra hot. Again, everyone in line sort of looked at each other helplessly as this happened. 

--this is a small thing, but they have multiple sizes for every drink on their board, but then half of them apparently only come in one size? I know it's a small issue, but you'd think it would occur to someone to change the menu so they don't have to keep telling people (last time I was there it happened to both me and the woman behind me). 

Jersey Java owners, please give your baristas some basic lessons in customer service. Again, they know their coffee, and they're generally nice until there's ANY sort of minor hiccup, and then all basic common sense goes right out the window. Your coffee is too expensive for me to have some ordeal every time I go there. Oh, and buy more half and half.",-1
"This was my second time going 
First time service was very slow,
Because it's new ,I let that pass
2nd time 11/30/14 
There was hair in our food and not one but 4 plates
Inexcusable !!!
I will not return",-1
Every time I go there the service is terrible nd today they didn't have anything except pulled port. Terrible service and terrible management,-1
"Full disclosure...I stumbled on this place by accident and didn't drink, so why 4 stars? Well, Waze led me astray for the first time ever and took us to this address. The employees chuckled that we meant to go to St Ben's. They kindly offered a tour of their magnificent building, interspersing it with whiskey trivia. If I wasn't such a cheap date, I'd have had samples but whiskey before beer is a no go for me. I will go back for sure. Being kind to folks wandering thru South Kensington is a sure fire way to gain a customer next time I'm in those parts.",1
I finally found Daisy after a series of bad hair cuts. She immediately diagnosed the problem and we talked about what styles work and don't work for my hair and face. Then she transformed my dysfunctional cut into an adorable low maintenance bob and I've never been happier. She is absolutely the best and I can't recommend her enough!,1
"Definitely should have read the reviews first.   Ordered $100 worth of pizza for a 13 year Olds birthday.  Gave then 2 hours notice.  The pizza still showed up an hour late, cold and tasteless.  Absolutely awful.    Never again.",-1
"This is my first review and I really felt it was needed.  I love to cook but also love eating out . It's very exciting to see all the new restaurants opening up around town and I really want them all to succeed. I've been to Nox  many times now. I have to say it's been so inconsistent last night being the Worst!!!  Waitstaff were inexperienced, appetizers came out with the dinners and only one was hot.  Had to send two out of the three dinners back for various reasons.  As you know Restaurants seem to come and go around here so please guys pay attention and remember you're only as good as your staff. 
Sincerely",-1
"Overpriced and pretentious...this outfit charges 2x the normal price for everything.  Didn't try all of the 17 restaurants, but what I did have was just average. 

Rooms weren't even as nice as the much lower priced Hampton Inn.  

Cannot express how disappointed I was.  Seemed like if you just looked at something they charged you for it.  

The interior gardens were nice but really not worth it. This is Disney World for adults",-1
Comcast if you think you are going to get money back that they took when account was close forget it also when u take in your equipment they dont have a clue where the equipment is very poir business to deal with make sure you take lots of notes abd record every confersation si frustrated with this company will never use them again,-1
"Just got home from my LONG drive to Philadelphia PA. I had a house full of guests  and the general consensus for dinner was island cuisine. Unfortunately, I forgot that this is the Penn Relay weekend (huge mistake). After driving 1.5 hour and taking 30 minutes to find a $15 parking space, I finally arrived. The place was not too packed but half the patrons were gathered around the ordering counter. It took me a few minutes to realize that this increadibly roudy, vulgar bunch had aready placed their orders but were just hanging out at the counter, thus preventing newly arrived customers from placing their orders. I tried my best to get noticed and to get to the counter but had no luck. Ultimately, I and a few other customers (or should I say ""potential customers"" eventually gave up and left. The cincher for me was that the staff were clearly aware of what was occurring but made no attempt to control the crowd. I may have waited if the staff showed some business savvy and kept the counter area clear but unfortunately, they appeared overwhelmed and confused. i've eaten at the Jerk Hut several times (food is OK-good) but this visit left a bad taste in my mouth so I may have to reconsider future trips across the bridge for authentic JA CUISINE!!
PS: Memo from prior visits, their wait staff can be a bit rude.",-1
"we went to this place at around 3pm on a Monday. The place was empty lol 
the server brought the food after 15minutes or so. However, the food was delicious. I liked their Thai chicken on flat bread. 
I suggest going here at a busy hour instead.",1
"The red beans and rice was good. The chicken was good. They would probably make more money if they let a person substitute and I'm not saying it has to be difficult. If I get a 2 piece white, why can't I get two wings? Instead of breast and wing, just so simple and your customer is happy!!I also heard they are running a special menu during Essence Fest to make life more difficult!!",1
"I went to André Richards yesterday for the first time because I had. groupon for a wash, cut, trim, dry and highlights and because I've been looking for a good place in Philly.  The salon had a good set up with plenty of space, especially for a Philly salon. It's kind of hidden on Locust Street, but spacious. 

I was about 5 minutes late due to parking further away, but the salon got me in and within a few minutes, LB was going over what I wanted. She was super cool and we had some good conversation while the foils were going in. After they were all put in and set, the foils came out, toner went in for some more waiting. LB was good about checking up on things and offering coffee, water and tea. After everything was done setting, I got a good cut that was exactly what I asked for. I was pleased itch the outcome and it really didn't feel like it took 3 hrs like it has at other places I've been too! I wish I had found this place sooner",1
"welcome to mediocre (at best) cuisine.  they're a chain.  expect nothing more.  when I ordered a ""healthy choices"" chicken dish, it came SMOTHERED in pepper.  when I complained, the chef was very accommodating, but I was a little confused by her reply ""yeah, when I cook at home, I never use pepper on my food.  there's just a lot of pepper in the sauce.""  
YES.  I KNOW.  and why would you serve food that you, as a chef, would never eat?  two stars only because they didn't charge me for the chicken entree.  otherwise, two thumbs DOWN.
oh yeah- 
host service= idiot 16 year olds that don't know the first thing about customer service
wait service= incompetent",-1
"Drove 3 hours to get my smog done because I'm a college student and my car is still registered in Nevada. On top of needing the smog done, I needed an oil change and the transmission fluid changed. As soon as they were done, I needed to get back home to California and I was going to register online. When I got home, i realized the smog was never performed and I had to call out of work and drive 3 hours back to get the smog done!! 0/5 rating. I shouldn't have had to pay for the smog. Never coming here again.",-1
"Why is this called a rotisserie? The only rotisserie they seem to have is the sign outside.
Super bland, luke-warm food. The salad had parsley in it and no asparagus as it said it did. 
Service was almost laughable, although I feel for our server, she was no the friendliest and was obviously feeling stressed out. 
I'm also confused because the menu on their website has many more options than their menu in the restaurant. 
Overall, it's overpriced and not worth it.",-1
I am the one who had the half green tomatoes served on my salad and brought it to the attention of management. The menu listed egg on the salad and there was none. The manager comped my salad and apologized. The table where we were seated was on the corner of the restaurant and I ended up with the sun full in my face. A man seated in a booth behind me was having the same problem. I turned around and sat on the other side of my table but the sun was still shining into the side of my eye and was very uncomfortable. My son's tacos looked wonderful but were served cold so that was not a good experience either. I'm not too sure that we will be going back there again.,-1
"The last time I was here, I got take-out.  Let me say, they prepared it really well!  The bulgogi and kalbi were in foil inside the styrofoam boxes.  The kalbi was juicy!  The rice was a little bit soggy, but still good.  The meat for both dishes were really good.  I was a little bit disappointed when they didn't have the little containers of pickled veggies in the kim chee sauce.  The price of both dishes were well worth it.",1
"I took my car to have the left headlight replaced, in Oct 2015. the price was reasonable. I had to take my car again in Dec 2015, because the headlight wasn't installed correctly(facing downward) it was fixed (no charge). And then again back to Sears auto Jan 27th because my headlight had gone out! At this point my blood is boiling! Because of employee negligence! Couldn't get it right the 1st time! Although I will say I wasn't charged, not that I would have paid for a headlight that I had already paid for 3 months ago! My headlight on the drivers side was replaced 2 yrs ago and as of today has not been replaced! Smdh.  I will NEVER TAKE MY CAR HERE AGAIN! Stay away!! Small details were overlooked. Needless to say, I didn't get good customer service and it's a good distance from my home, but close to my work.",-1
I read at least 30 reviews before I decided to eat here. The only thing that was good was the oysters because it's raw. Everything else was dry and tasteless. The space is cramp. We had people on our backs coughing on us while sitting at the bar trying to enjoy it. Let's just say the 2 half and half baskets that my boyfriend and I ordered was not worth $60.,-1
"I have had a few pretty good experiences here and one really negative one that prompted our party to leave before eating. 

Generally speaking, the food is good. It's the best Italian in town, in my opinion, but my mother would fight me on that one. They start you off with some complimentary bruschetta, which is nice. I recommend the Mixed Baby Greens salad to start, which is more like a Greek salad and is a generous portion for $5. I would also recommend the Porcini Stuffed Agnolotti. I have tried a few of their desserts - I liked the Chocolate Souffle but thought the Coppa Pistachio left something to be desired. The free limoncello shot at the end of the meal is a nice touch.

The problem here is the service. It seems that there is always a wait, even if you have a reservation. I don't usually mind waiting but they have very little standing room and no vestibule, so you end up standing by the door and get blasted with cold air every time someone opens it. I went recently with my family for their lunch buffet, which looked quite nice. We ended up waiting about 25 minutes, during which the hostess sat several smaller parties (which is fine), then started to seat a slightly larger party that had come in long after us. When we interjected to find out what was going on and why we had been passed over, the hostess said something along the lines of ""Oh I don't know, you all walked in at once."" We had been there much longer, but apparently she hadn't been keeping a list (she told us so) even though she had been taking names. Isn't that what hostesses DO? Only upon us asking why this was happening and expressing our unhappiness with the service did she run off to check with a manger then report back that she needed to seat the larger party, without explanation. By this time the buffet was close to its end time and it seemed silly to pay only to receive the last bits and pieces, so we decided to leave and go down the street to Kooma where we were seated immediately and had a delicious brunch!

This restaurant is fine and a good choice if you are craving Italian food, but I generally prefer other places in West Chester. Also, be prepared for a wait and a potentially rude hostess!

But by the way, Richard works here now - he used to work at Gilmore's and is the best waiter in town!",-1
"This place is really poor on the service. I don't think they know how to handle the rush of people that come in from South St. The tables get cleaned hap-haphazardly and they don't bother wiping down the seats so when we got our spots I had to brush off a few french fries from the previous meal. 2 Stars because they apparently still know how to make a good Malt, even if it was a little expensive.",-1
If you can't come to work with pride and energy and enthusiasm then don't work at a McDonald's where people are in a hurry to get somewhere else.....so disappointed in the behavior of humans!,-1
"A pho place that checks all the boxes but doesnt have the best of anything.  We went to Lily's the day before, so I guess this review is a compare and contrast.  Decor is simple, white wall with 7 frames of challenge winners and 2 laggy TVs.  The service is fine, not as personal, but nothing really to complain.  The food was the biggest difference between the places.  The pho was plain, no complexity, almost like it came from a dry seasoning pack.  They also recommended the chicken vermicelli as one of their best -- it wasn't.  First off, they call it vermicelli but they used pho noodle instead?  What!!?? It was thick, heavy, and full the stomach quick --- everything a vermicelli not suppose to be.  Anyway, we left unsatisfied.",-1
"This place is so scummy. Do not go here. I had an entire purse stolen with car keys, iphones, passport inside and no one working was willing to even look if it was turned in, behind the bar or help me out. They told me ""it happens all the time"". Unfriendly and untrustworthy. Do not waste your time.",-1
"Awesome location, good service is why I have been eating there for the past 15 years off and on. Mostly the excuses about the steak is why I have to write the review. I am happy to pay more for good quality steak but don't blame the poor guy that sold it to you !",1
"We expected so much more from an SPG Hotel. We stayed at the Aloft because we were in town for a funeral and we are SPG preferred members. However.....this hotel left a lot to be desired. 

We paid in advance online and arrived late in the evening to check-in, the parking lot was packed, we drove around for quite some time to find a space and then walked a short distance to the front doors of the hotel and the lobby was packed! Music playing, people seated at the bar, playing pool and just sort-of hanging out. We were extremely exhausted after driving in from New Jersey. After attending a funeral, repass at the church and then again at the home of the family, it was quite a long day and we were a bit hungry and tired.   

We checked in, paid $10.00 for parking (which I'll talk more about shortly) and asked if they had room service, which they do not and we were given a menu of a place that delivered. We took the elevator to our floor and as soon as we stepped off the elevator we were greeted with dog poop on the floor. As we walked down the hall to our room, we were greeted with the smell of weed, pot, Mary Jane, marijuana or whatever you want to call it. We got into our room and called the front desk and advised them of the dog poop and then placed an order with Femi's pizza for delivery. 

My boyfriend then went down to the hotel bar to grab a drink, as he sat down at the bar there was a woman and man seated beside him and he could hear their entire conversation, the young woman was telling the gentleman her cost for SERVICES, yes, those services! My boyfriend took a few sips of his drink and got up to come back to our room, he was then approached by THREE women who asked him if they could go back to his room with him, he said no thank you, and that he had a girlfriend upstairs that he was going back to, and they said, ""too bad, you could have had some fun tonight"" 

Once back safely our room the food delivery called to say that the hotel would not let me up and that we needed to come down to pick up our food. We ate and went right to sleep. The next morning we woke to the sounds of planes departing and arriving, we showered, dressed and checked out of the hotel. 

As I mentioned earlier, I would tell you about parking. We paid the additional $10.00 for parking as parking was not included. We got to the gate to slide in our paid parking pass and the gate was GONE, their was nothing there and we just drove away and headed back to New Jersey. 

The hotel and rooms are quite trendy, the shower was nice and the complimentary body wash and 2 in1 shampoo and conditioner were nice. However, there was a bit of a sour smell coming from the drain, the bed was pretty basic, I would not want to sleep on it more that one night. The wall unit a/c turned on and off all night, I tried to adjust the temp on the unit itself and it would not adjust. I noticed the thermostat on the wall and tried adjusting it and it did not work either, so I just unplugged the unit.  

Whenever we go back to Philadelphia, we will not stay at the Aloft and I do not recommend it.",-1
"Being very generous with even two stars. It's a nice place to be to listen to entertainment and have a drink, however to eat.. is not acceptable. I was waiting over two hours to be seated and then when we were finally seated we were sitting down for over 30 minutes before we had to ask for a manager to even get us some drinks. Waited over an hour to even receive food, my salad was room temperature if not warm. My entree was pretty good, however the rest of my party's food wasn't even cooked properly. Drinks are strong which is great but i will never be returning here, ever.",-1
"I was cleaning out my father's house.  The basement was a mess of junk collected over 50 years.  The 1-800-Got-Junk phone rep said, ""you just sit back and relax and let our people do everything.  You can leave your items where they are and we'll take care of it all.  She then explained the pricing.  The two young guys arrived the next day on time (at the beginning of the 2-hr window).   They surveyed the work, explained the pricing again, and gave me the option to cancel.  They then went about their work quickly and efficiently - and even cleaned and swept when they were done.  It was a bit pricey - but it saved me hours of work and the hassle of dump runs and/or renting a dumpster.  They also told me that they recycle and donate as much as they can.  I highly recommend this company, and would use them again.",1
"I've been here several times just cause I live in the area. Its kinda a scam ... or maybe its a joke.  Jackson's serves mediocre bar food at best, thats it.... mediocre at BEST.... and its way over priced for the quality and thought put into the dishes.  The bar is nice & I enjoy sitting outside when the weather is agreeable... but the service is pretty horrid.  If I didnt have previous restaurant experience and know what its like to work for tips, I wouldn't tip at all.  I have had several nights where I have walked in with a GROUP of friends and it has taken twenty plus minutes to get a drink order .... then another thirty minutes to get my dos perros to the table.  

Moral of the story: Jackson's thrives off of there location ... Seriously, there is nothing impressive about there menu.  And there hipster prick servers add the topping on the pretentious asshole cake.",-1
"Just average.  Pizza crust, while giving all the appearance of a true VPN, was tough and chewy.  Disappointing.",-1
"This place is cute and I enjoyed myself. The salon was beautiful and well kept, and the owner or manager desk person was a total delight and I would go back for lashes or just a pedi bc the pedi there was honestly incredible the tech had me in heaven. Also the prices were reasonable.

But the mani is just meh. I didn't really inspect my nails when I left bc I was in a hurry. It's just frustrating I can do my own nails better and paint all the way to the sides without leaving a gap. But toying with an at-home LED lamp is a pain.

So the nitty gritty: There are little bumps and bubbles. I had to pick clear and colored gel off my skin later and trim where it had pooled in cuticles with nail scissors. Several nails were filed slightly assymetrically. Also they do something called wrapping their tips with a extra layer so it's sealed under and looks kind bulbous on the nail, like thicker visibly and to the touch at the tips. 

That being said the tech was super sweet and genuinely nice. But if I went again I would just stick to a pedi or request someone else for a mani.",1
Have been going there over 20 years & always had great friendly service which has resulted in 4-6 hours stay. Went there Sunday and the bartender Michelle was rude and uninterested in doing her job. There was only us and 3 of her friends in the bar. In the time we had 1 drink 4 couples walked in sat down & she never acknowledged them and of course they walked out. She was more interested in her friends and the music she was playing on her phone then making herself or the bar owner any money. I was disappointed and sad that a person like her was hired.,-1
"So my boyfriend and I would consider ourselves Mexican food experts.  We've checked out every mexican restaraunt in the city and our checklist for what may put a place on our rotation or take it off is a short one: 1) delicious salsa served wit warm fresh chips 2) mouth watering margaritas 3) flavorful food served piping hot! In order to do evaluations in the name of science we alwayd order the same thing....house margarita on the rocks, dos equis amber draft and an order of cicken fajitas to share. Tonight the margarita was average, nothing to write home about, and the beer was warm....yikes! The chips and salsa were tasty...the salsa was unique with lots of cilantro.....a necessary mexican flavor.  The fajitas were served piping hot and tasted good...but lacked any remarkable factor...other than extra greasy.  I would say that overall it wasan average experience except fo the service...our server was either terrbly rude or terribly shy...it was hard to tell. He barely visted the table and never let either of us finish a sentence before he started to walk away...resulting in us getting our food not the way we ordered it....sans sour cream. The atmosphere is fun and bright but if its killer mexican food you're after.......Friacos is just down the street.",1
"I'm not one to watch the chef shows so celebrity chefs don't do me. That said, the food was creative and cutting edge. We had the  four course tasting menu. The dishes have many flavors that reveal themselves to you one at a time which is fun. Small portions, but enough food. I had a wonderful glass of Argentinian wine which was fun. My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.  Wonderful service. Really top notch which is becoming more and more rare these days.",1
"I am no expert on burgers, but I do know what I like. When I saw the Guacamole Bacon burger on the menu, I knew I'd end up ordering it! It was cooked just how I asked (medium), but there wasn't a whole lot of guac on it, so I asked for a side, so I was happy! The garlic Parmesan  fries were not as good as I had expected. Not a lot of garlic or parm throughout the fries. Upon our second go-around of fries, the garlic and parm seemed more generous. I think I can do better if I try something on my own at home! I did enjoy some sweet potato fries and whatever it is that they serve it with, I need to find me some for home. It was a spicy type of ketchup dip,but ran more on the jelly/jam side.

Service was decent. At first our waitress was very present, but then when we needed drink refills (and more fries), she was nowhere to be seen. Otherwise she was pleasant and thought to bring us more napkins before we had asked. 

The wait was about 25 minutes, but there were 5 of us and we asked for a table. Loud place, but not bothersome. I think I'll stick to Five Guys for my burger fix (but I would still come back here, though!)",1
"I'll keep this brief. I came in for an oil change and a half hour later they return to me letting me know they cannot service the car because the engine needs replacing. Yes, the engine. So I drove to the dealership and they changed the oil for $40. No engine replacement necessary.",-1
"This is good southern barbecue meets fast food. Excellent pulled pork / beef / turkey barbecue, on a typical fast food bun. By default it comes with mayonaise, cole slaw, and pickles on the burger (so be sure to ask for those to be omitted if you don't like them).

I had the pulled pork. It was juicy and tasty. The beef was good, but a bit dry. Service was quite fast, and there is a drive through.

Note: No seating available at this location, so this is To-Go only.

They have very minimal choice of sides (slaw, baked beans, or potato chips). Not particularly healthy. But still quite tasty.",1
So hopefully i can change this review...because the hostess was great but the first come first serve bar seating area is a mess. The tables are dirty and we waited for 15 mins for someone to clean off the table after my Husband wiped it down himself.,-1
"Stayed here for work and it was the only place in town that had availability. Check in was a breeze and my room was nice. Free tea and coffee and very clean and fresh smelling room. Lobby was large and open. Breakfast buffet is an option that I took advantage of two days ($16.95), it would be nice if breakfast could be included like other hotels in the area. Parking is expensive $38 a day, bit work is paying so no harm to me. Close to the ballpark and Washington street where all the bars and restaurants are. Walking distance to the arch. I think I'll try another hotel next time.",-1
"OK, I'm going to be Debbie Downer.

Awful coffee. Just awful.

Maybe that's not fair. I have yet to sample all of their fare, and perhaps it's a bad idea to fit them into the mold that Mugshots (which was gone before I arrived in Manayunk) occupied. But in the end, they call themselves a cafe, which translates into a coffee shop, moved into the location of a former coffee shop and they include baked goods and coffee on the menu, so I feel comfortable in holding them to some standard.

They were out of their banana bread. All of it. For all the flavors they described, they didn't have a single one left when I arrived. This is a significant portion of their menu, and they were out of all of it, which tells me that they have problems with keeping things in stock They had plenty of Baklava, but I'm allergic to two of the nuts they use in them, so even experimenting is a horrible idea.

There was a small child running around screaming, and I could hear arguing breaking out as I stepped through the door with my coffee. I'm not saying that without empathy, but that is never something you want your customers getting to be a part of. Even if the food had been perfect, it would have detracted from the experience

And...the coffee...I have to  go back to that. I really do. If I has handed a mug of Starbucks and was told that someone had urinated in it, and my only other option was what I had here...I would seriously have to debate that decision. This is a horrible thing to say. It's cruel, and cruel honestly isn't that much more helpful than well meaning lies. It's even more horrible to look at in the cold light of day, and determine that it's still a correct assessment. But this is someone who, during his broke college days, would drink coffee through day old grounds. Someone who used an abandoned French press that was held together with duct tape, and I couldn't finish it. Seriously, it was that bad. I don't know how they did it, and that cup was an accomplishment in of itself.

Maybe the owners are nice folk. Maybe, their Mediterranean food is really good, as other reviews seem to indicate. But they sure as shit ain't a cafe. If they want to be cheery, and have great falafel, they should do that. But dear God in heaven, who I have forsaken in so many ways, they put something on the menu so bad I am still  shocked. Combined with a lack of stock and that atmosphere, I can't possibly give this place a good rating.",-1
"Be very wary of using credit cards here - unscrupulous activity in the backroom. This review is not for the food which is excellent. I have never had but positive experiences at Penang regarding the food - excellent dishes. Last night ate at the restaurant with two friends. Had two excellent appetizers - Roti Canai and chicken/beef sticks. For our main courses we had the pad Thai and another chicken dish with rice. Waiter came by with the bill and I handed him my credit card. Seemed to take a longer time than usual even though they were not overwhelming busy. I was not able to see where the waiter took my credit card to - though it appeared to travel through a back door alongside of the kitchen area. The check comes back fully processed, I add a tip and almost immediately (within the next 5 minutes - I kid you not) I receive an email warning from Capital One (on my cell phone) notifying me of a fraudulent charge for $348.51 at a Royal Farms / Fresh Kitchen (Gas station & convenience store) down at Ridley Park, PA close to the airport. How can I be in two places at once? Created a red flag across Capital One servers. Word of caution - use cash if coming to Penang.",-1
Don't bother going.  The servers are too busy dancing to take your order.  Waited  30 minutes and never had our order taken.    But the servers danced two songs.,-1
"Salad was good.  Pizza is not good!  Boring, tasteless and just unsatisfying.  Very disappointed.  Also on a chilly night it is a cold interior.  This was my third try there.  Won't go back",-1
"This is pretty average Mexican food. Way better than Taco Bell (I don't usually classify Taco Bell as Mexican food, but I'm sure others do), but not nearly as good as some other places. There aren't a lot of restaurants that I can walk to from my house, so I'm really happy these guys are here. But if I have a craving for some really good Mexican food, I'm going to have to get in my car.

I've been here 3 times now, and I've gotten the tacos, tostadas, and enchiladas. These were all pretty good. I think the tostadas have been my favorite so far. My husband got a burrito and he said it was just ""ok."" For sides, the refried beans are pretty legit, but the rice is pretty bad. Either the rice is really old and dried out, or it's not cooked long enough. Either way I don't like my rice crunchy. The tortilla chips and salsa at the table aren't anything special. I do like the green and red hot sauce they have on all of the tables. My husband and I grew up on the west coast, so we have pretty high standards for our Mexican food.

Since this place is pretty new, I'm hoping they improve, and I will update this review if they do. I will keep eating here unless they give me a reason not to. I hope they stick around!",1
Good cuts.but watch out they don't keep to the posted gours.  It's frustrating to drive 20 minutes to find out they closed earlry.  Happens s lot. Call first,-1
"Went with a friend around 12:30. We walked the entire store upstairs and down. The 3 employees completely ignored us. There was one other customer at the register. Small, locally owned business with nice mdse BUT with NO customer service, what's the point. They loss lots of money in sales from us. Won't go back.",-1
We didn't have reservations but were able to be seated. The service was terrific. The portions for both dinner and dessert were large. They have Coke products. It's BYOB. I'd definitely return. I'd make reservations because I felt badly causing the hostess to rearrange tables to accommodate our party of 5.,1
"The idea of this place is great. All you can eat for a great price. Only the quality of the food isn't all that awesome. Got extremely chewy bland steak hibachi, nothing too great about the sushi, waiter was stacking food plates when dropping them off at the table, got the wrong food a few times, and overall really slow service. I'm glad I tried it out, might go back again for another chance. We shall see.",-1
"Setting: awesome. Very chill, tiki atmosphere on the back patio. A propane fire pit and amble seating

Food: as Rachel Ray would say, ""delish!"" 

Drinks: great flavor, not overly sweet. Very reasonable prices. 

Service: Here's the downfall. Our server was really nice. I've had her on two separate visits. On my last visit I asked for water when she came and greeted me after I had been sitting for a few minutes. 15 mins later she returned and I asked for water again and a beer. 30 mins into the visit she came with my beer and water. I gulped the water down because it was in the 80's and it took about another 20mins to get a refill. After my group had joined me at the table earlier in the evening, it took about 10-15mins for our server to come over and take their drink order. I was disapointed in the wait times because I did not feel like she was engaged in managing her tables and we would sit with empty drinks while she spoke with her co workers at the bar here and there. 

I will likely return because I like the food, and atmosphere so much. However, I'll have to choose when to visit wisely because it will likely be a lengthy process to order based on the speed of service in the past.",-1
"We went with the simple choice and were not disappointed. Eggs, bacon and buttermilk pancakes. I can't put my finger on exactly what it was that made them so good, but the pancakes were divine! Worth it in our opinion! Even saw a girl from the voice while dining here!",1
"Bob Diehl is one of the best mechanics I've ever dealt with. I had a Mercedes Benz that I'd owned for years and only drove in the Summer months. It always started right up after being in storage for the Winter one year it was somewhat hard starting. I took it to the M-B dealer who kept it for three days and had the mechanic come and talk to me when I picked it up. The mechanic tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong and that was the way it should be, I asked around and learned about Bob. I brought the car to him, he fixed the problem and informed me that the car had three cold start systems and two weren't working right. Minor repairs set them right and the car stared as it always had. Bob charged me little or nothing for the work and I then became a loyal client. I eventually sold the car and was upset that Bob didn't work on any other marques. I understand that he may, now. 

I'd buy a used M-B if for no other reason than I'd know I'd have a great mechanic who could work on it. He is extremely knowledgeable, highly competent, and his prices are very reasonable.",1
"Not the best burgers in the city, but it's my favorite out of the other burger-oriented places in the area. They have a large menu with interesting options, different meats and milkshakes. The hot honey is delicious. 

They serve some of their chicken sandwiches with funky cuts of meat, so if you're a white-meat only eater then ask before ordering. I've had one bad experience with an order and the manager rectified it, so they're fine in my book.

Have ordered delivery a few times and it always came within their estimated time.",1
Service sucks!  We had a party of 12.  We couldn't get enough chips.  We got 1!  I ordered table side guacamole and had to ask for chips.  We couldn't get drinks.  Waitress couldn't keep focused on each person and was very scattered.  Won't be back for the spendy Mexican food.,-1
"Went here when they first opened. They only had one flavor... it wasn't that great. Everything was overpriced and we left spending about 70-80 dollars for three people and it wasn't filling. 
*it is not Cajun style seafood. The sauce tastes like a mixture between buffet style sauces with fish sauce. 
Giving them a solid three because there are better places to eat at",-1
"Nice enough ambiance - looks very promising on first glance, but the food and service were a huge disappointment. I ordered the steak sandwich because of the promising ingredients (I like strongly seasoned dishes) but was SMACKED in the face with a single note - BEEF. Chewy, chewy beef. 
This was especially disappointing because I was torn between several sandwiches. The waitress, however, was disinterested and absent almost our whole meal (the bus person was diligent and pleasant) and completely uninterested in addressing the questions I had about the choices. 
Would definitely not come again and would recommend skipping it.",-1
"I can't believe that I am only now reviewing this place. I was seen at this urgent care back in October when I had my bike accident and broke a finger.

It was a Friday afternoon and I was pedaling away trying to get to a museum on time for a volunteer shift. Unfortunately I chose to stay on Carondelet with the streetcar tracks, which led to my downfall. While trying to go around a parked FedEx truck, I hadn't completely made up my mind whether I was going to switch lanes or stay on the one I was on, and I tried to go across the streetcar tracks diagonally. Diagonally because I hadn't actually made a commitment to cross before executing this move (you are supposed to be perpendicular to such tracks). This immediately led to my front wheel falling into one of the tracks and me falling onto my bike which had fallen, landing with most of my weight on my left hand, breaking my left pinky.

I knew that I had a broken finger as soon as I lifted myself up from the ground. I was thinking that I would have to get to an emergency room. Folks asked me if I needed an ambulance. I remember saying something like, ""I broke a finger. I can walk...""

Luckily for me, the person who saw me fall from my bike was on her way to meet with two friends who just happened to be nurses. She called them to come take a look at me (only in nola!). One of the nurses had heard about the urgent care, which is how I ended up at this place. Mind you, when she called, it was 6:20 and they only admitted patients until 6:30. We were 6 blocks away and made it in to register by 6:28.

The folks at New Orleans Urgent Care did not show one sign of annoyance at my arrival two minutes before the cutoff time. They took down my information, took x-rays of my hand, called in a doctor who had already gone home just for me (she came back in to see me at almost 7 pm on a Friday evening and did not make me feel like a terrible person), and took very good care of me in a moment of confusion and fear. I had never broken a bone before and didn't know what to expect. The doctor (Dr. Ajsa Nikolic) explained everything through each process and referred me to a hand surgeon (the best in the region, she said) because I needed surgery.

The only thing I wish she would have done differently is to tell me that it was okay to take more pain medication. She prescribed the medicine for twice a day and when I was in so much pain for the next couple of days (once the initial shock was gone and the pain became more prominent), I didn't know if it was okay to take more pills. I didn't want to self medicate and OD because the medication contained narcotics. Just wish she would've told me the maximum amount one could take in a day.

But I forgive her because she did take good care of me when I was there and when I went back in to get my hand re-wrapped the next day because the splint moved while I was sleeping, they were happy to help me out and did not charge me anything.

I have insurance so for me the payment was a $50 copay and a bill that came later for $34. If I had gone to an ER, copay would've been $100 and I would have had to wait for hours before being seen.

Gladly giving them five stars.",1
"Been looking for a better breakfast place for awhile now - where the food is good and you don't wait an hour to get in. This place hit the spot on all fronts. It's quiet, and small - maybe 40 seater, with 12 of those seats outside. The menu isn't huge but that's okay. They make up for it by ensuring it's fresh, cooked to order and really tasty. We tried some regular menu standards - breakfast sandwich and a chicken fried steak - in both cases, got far more (quality-wise) than we were expecting. I'll be back to try the brunch specials, and the weekend dinner service looks pretty good, too.",1
"After getting my car damaged in a minor hit and run, I was told that Calvin's does great work at an affordable price. I used to live very close to the shop and was happy I could give my old neighborhood's shop some business. I called ahead and set a time, Calvin was very nice and professional. When I got there, he helped me right away. He started doing the estimate and started asking questions. While talking, I told him I already had a claim in for the damage. He immediately changed his tone, refusing to finish the estimate. Insisting my insurance company would not accept his estimate. This was very confusing since I already had my insurance company's estimate and the cash was in my account. I tried to explain it to him but he wouldn't listen to what I was saying. This was just a bad experience.",-1
"They are new in market, more like runned by ameture but though too pricy !!

We ordered for Prawns 65 and veg Manchurian for appetizers. Veg Manchurian was undercooked and prawns 65 was just fine in taste but really small portion to it's cost. Then we had to wait for almost half an hour for our briyanis, which very quiet dry. Chicken was too chew seem like it wasn't fresh. Later discovered that they had made our briyanis to go so we had to wait long for it's services. 

Service is too slow and protion are too small for it's price. Won't recommend this place at all.",-1
"Food was really flavorful! 
My favorite was the Nuoc Mía (sugarcane drink) and the bun Rieu. 
Portions were huge and extremely affordable. 
They gave you plenty of vegetables for your soups. 
And such a pretty presentation as well. 

The only downfall was the slow wait time and mean and rude service.",1
"Wonderful company to do business with. We had two homes outside of Tucson that were left in questionable condition after a bad contractor had his way with them and needed a reputable licensed electrician to go over everything with a fine toothed comb. Bonnie understood our situation as we already had a buyer for the home, ready to move in and needed to address any potential issues ASAP. She sent us Anthony, a wonderful guy who really knows his stuff. He did a thorough job of reviewing the entire service, including the breaker boxes, lines throughout each structure as well as the outlets and switches. One week later he was out addressing each item that was a cause of concern so that we could hand over the keys to our buyer with confidence, knowing that the homes were safe and fully operational. I highly recommend Buddy Heilig & Sons to anyone in the local Tucson area needing electric service!",1
"Went there for lunch and was pleasantly surprised, as having recently moved to Tampa from Los Angeles, I have been disappointed by the food.  However, I give Ploy Thai 4 stars, not just by Tampa standards, but by good food standards.  The food was very flavorful and the ingredients very fresh.",1
Really poor seating management. 6:00 on a Sunday and the hostess has seated several parties of 2 at 4 tops leaving all the small tables open and no tables for larger parties. Then suggests I go eat at the bar with my minor children.,-1
"I went to see Dr. Lake with pretty severe knee trouble (i.e. ongoing and increasing pain, popping, cracking when walking, going up/down stairs, sitting, etc).  Dr. Lake was very nice, but his assistant was a challenge to deal with.  Dr. Lake prescribed an MRI, which was denied by my insurance company.  My insurance company said the doctor could appeal the decision by writing a letter, so I called the office.  Tracy, Dr. Lake's assistant at Premiere, said they would not be willing to write the letter to appeal.  When I asked why Premiere wouldn't write the appeal, she said ""Talk to your insurance company"" and hung up.  Headed over to Penn Orthopedics, who said they'd get me the MRI.",-1
"I have been here many times and it's always hit or miss.  You either get a ton of meat with plenty of sauce on a fresh, soft pita, or the bare minimum of meat and hardly any sauce on a dried-out, crumbly pita.  It's never in between, and there's no pattern or indication of whether it's gonna be good or bad. 
Service is always surly, but I'd be surly too if I spent my days waiting on drunken FQ fucktards.
Cash only.  Stop complaining and carry a little cash. (only $7-8 bucks for a gyro.)

All in all, if you're in doubt I'd say roll the bones and give it a shot.  Because even when they fuck it up it's still pretty good....",1
"Went with great expectations based on the word of a friend. Ten dollar cab ride there and back from our hotel down town. Gotta say it was  disappointing.  The ""Woodstock"" burger was tasty enough, but for eleven dollars they should have given me two of them. Bun was mushy super market variety and burger was not cooked as ordered (medium rare) I should have known it wouldn't be since the server didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked- I had to tell him after he took the order. I suspect they cook all the burgers the same. 
Fries were just plain crappy, limp and burnt. Do not make a special trip 'cause it aint special.",-1
I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday and the owner told me they were closed. They need to change the hours online and lock the doors when they're closed.,-1
"I went there with my friend, she just came from Arizona. I wanted to find a place can see the night view in Philly. The place is good, but the waitress was not good. The service is bad.

"We stayed at The Saint last year for a girl's trip. The lobby is lovely, they have a cool bar and restaurant that you can't help but to ""ohh and ahh"" over when you walk in.  All the things I'm accustomed too when I stay at a hotel anywhere...ambiance, a little sexy but not overkill! Everyone is so friendly, etc.  I'm thinking ""oh shhhh this is going to be a great weekend!""  I checked in a few hours before my girl arrived because I had a ton of work i needed to do. So I set up my laptop ordered some room service and worked for about 4 hours straight. Left out to buy a bottle and get a mani/pedi.  My girl arrives...its about to be some trouble in NOLA... the two of us and no supervision...we pop out for dinner, come back in giggling as usual and we see it...a HUGH flying roach.  I'm freaked out.  I literally walk right out of the room down to the front desk.  I CANNOT!!!! They tell me they're sending a maintenance worker to handle it.  NOT GOOD ENOUGH! If there's one that's bold enough to show itself, he has other cohorts that prefer to live behind the scenes. They give us another room but tell me they can't do more until 8am.  No the room the move us too also has small spiders and other dead small bugs in the corners of the window. The TV doesn't work and one of the lamps doesn't have bulbs in it! COME ON!  At this point its about 3am and I know I'm not staying here past 8:15am. I dont want to sit my purse let alone my luggage in this hotel! I go online to my normal go to hotel, The W and book us there for the rest of the trip! 8am comes and goes no manager comes to our room. I go down and demand to see someone immediately.  This younger gentlemen comes out and apologizes.  I thank him for his apology and politely request ALL of my money back immediately.   He obliged and asked if  I would consider coming back after changes have been made! Bless his heart. NO dear!",-1

"I have now tried this salon three times.  The first visit was on Mother's day.  Even though it was pretty crowded they moved through the waist list quickly.  I was a little surprised to be offered a drink, but quickly noticed that this must be a big selling point for them as most women were sipping on adult beverages.  I declined refreshments and was promptly handed info on more expensive options for my pedi.  Unlike other places in other states I had gone they did not do the massage of my calves with lotion or use the hot towel on my legs.  As soon as you go to the dry station they hound you for immidate payment.  The last time I went was the last straw.  They are already $5 more than the other salons for a basic pedi, but apparently I chose a color of polish that costs $5 more than the others making my 20 minute pedi $30 before tip.  The polish was not smooth started chipping in 2 days.  I will not return.",-1
"I drive the distance to have lunch here.  Seriously.  This is the most satisfying lunch in Boise to me.  A large bowl of pho, a bbq pork sammy to-go (for later in the afternoon), a Vietnamese coffee with boba.  Man- o  man.... the best.
I have made this a lunch staple about 50 times over.  The only time I have been a little disappointed is when they ran out of basil for the pho.  
They also need to make sure their bathroom is a little cleaner.
I have had pho in Boise in about 5 other locations.  This place has the best broth hands-down.",1
"First time at 1911 Smoke House, it's Saturday night (8/13/16) around 8pm and my wife and I ordered take out and just finished dinner.  We ordered the garlic parmesan wings, the brisket and the half ribs.  The wings and brisket was very good BUT the ribs were the worst I've EVER had.  Most ribs want to fall of the bone, this one didn't want  leave it.  It was like eating beef jerky but unfortunately the beef jerky was softer!  It was like 2 day old ribs that they just heated up. We honestly could not even chew the ends and the middle was so gummy.  I honestly don't make a fuss let alone go online to write a review but how the cook could have served and sold it to us warrants this review!  It's really such a shame because the place is so nice and the other items we ordered was very good.   -jose",-1
"Underwhelming, to say the least.  Came back here after years away only because they keep their kitchen open late.  Wish we had opted for a casino because the food here is completely uninspiring.  I had a tasteless steak sandwich on a too-big roll with an afterthought of a side salad. The place is nicely appointed and they have big menu which might be why nothing tastes great.  Moxies has been around forever and I expected so much more. I think if you are into playing some bar top machines this place is fine but would never suggest eating here just for the food.",-1
Need to update their store hours on yelp. We didn't even get to visit the store. We have family in town and we made an hour drive to go and check out strollers and the place is closed on Sunday (we even checked the hours on yelp first). We planned to spend a good amount of money on a stroller and now we will be spending our money elsewhere.,-1
"Perfect place to go  if you like waiting 20 minutes at the counter and getting dirty looks from the waiters while you're waiting for service. My friend and I made the mistake of coming here after being famished after a long day. Hey Johnny Rockets, I understand that you guys can get busy, but a quick acknowledgment that we existed would have sufficed. After finally waving down a waitress, we finally got a menu with a heavy sigh on the side as if we were troubling the staff. I urged my friend that we should probably leave, but we had already waited long enough, so I reluctantly ordered.
I got the original burger and fries as did my friend as per usual. Don't get me wrong, the burgers and fries are decent but definitely not worth the wait or hassle. Even the chocolate shake that I ordered was pretty good with a good consistency, but the taste of bad service still lingered and eventually overpowered the chocolate flavored concoction. Needless to say, I will definitely not be coming back to this location if it continues to be managed so rudely.",-1
Food is awesome. I'm a vegan and love their menu options and details on vegan and vegetarian options. I gave them 3 stars because of their outrageously slow service. The owner walks around in the way not able to even answer the phone to take orders. I told the waitress he just needs to stay home observing him look totally oblivious to EVERYTHING. Servers are all nice and food is great. Come here only if you are patient.,1
"The atmosphere was good, however I didn't like the music. So loud.

If you are looking for Japanese Ramen noodle, Don't ever order. 
It's taste horrible. If you cook instant ramen is better.
 
I was waiting for my check for10min? Our server didn't come to our table.

I won't go there again.",-1
"Let me start by saying that the food was was a solid 4stars.  Portions as well.  I enjoyed my basil chicken while my date had peppered beef which was a tad bland for my liking. The only reason for not giving this place 4 stars was the service.  We didnt receive our waters until the entrees came and the waitress was generally unattentive. Also a bit odd was that rice must me ordered as a side. Southeast Asian food without rice??? Never heard of sucha thing. But Everything considered, it is worth a try.",1
Cashier was very rude fat Hispanic girl at the airport location. Very very rude. Half the menu wasn't even available.,-1

"Having walked almost 30 minutes in the heat, up in arrival I was excited to see the hype of Cemetery #1. The future burial site of Nicholas Cage, the famous voodoo dr-Marie Laveau, and supposedly the evil Madame Lalaurie. But at the front gate was a tour guide demanding that we pay $20 to look. C'mon are you kidding me? To browse, you are going to charge me. Um no thanks. Especially if I walked another 5 min to Cemetary #2 and browsed for FREE. I can understand if they use that money to up keep with the cemetery,  but after peeking in through a side fence, what exactly is the $20 used for? I'm not paying someone to tell me ghost stories that I probably already heard. Thanks but not thanks.",1
I cant stand this hotel. I have had two very bad experiences here. I needed a room at 8pm one night and was going to be out by 5am and they were unwilling to accomodate or discount the rate. Im also a starwood member and they still were very unfriendly and I very un-accommodating. I would rather sleep in an alley then try to stay here again. They suck!,-1
"I'm always a little nervous trying new salons... I'm picky with what is done to my hair; however I was pleasantly surprised!! Matt did an awesome job and really listened to what I wanted. My hair was different colors (in a bad way) because of too many bleach blond high-lites. Matt made it look much more natural and actually listened when I asked for just a trim (instead of taking off too much). The price was a little steep but I did get full color.
I will be back!",1
We ordered hamburgers and had to take the aweful meat off just to stomach it. Waiter apolgized but still charged us full price plus $.95 per topping instead of menu price of $.50. Also took 13 mins to ring our check up as he waited other tables.,1
"Came here Saturday night with a few friends. Fun atmosphere when you walk in and, they have an outside area too. However we made our way upstairs to the second level of the bar, little less crowded but still good music to hangout and dance. The bartenders though we're terrible. Pretty sure one girl was more drunk than anyone in the bar. The other bartender was on the side talking to her boyfriend most of the time. I had to wait to be served a beer for a good fifteen minutes cause the intoxicated bartender was too incoherent to hear anyone's orders. My buddy had paid with a credit card and she forgot to give him his card and receipt. He had to stay there and yell ""can i have my card back"" half a dozen times before she realized. Get new bartenders upstairs!",-1
"The food ranks 3 stars but the service ranks only 1/2 star, dragging the over-all star rating down to a sub-zero number. 

I walked up to the counter, was looked at (though not acknowledged) and, after a span of time what seemed eternal, asked by a gal standing far back from the counter, ""Do you need something?"" 

""Food!"" I answered. Yep. Food. 

She continued on with what she was doing: the grueling task of flipping tortillas on a grill. I full expected the woman's head to twist a complete 360 degrees, a trick I once saw in the movie ""The Exorcist"". If I had been wearing a cross around my neck I think she no doubt would have begun to manifest, as her eyes were by this time rolling in their sockets and back into her head.

I promise not to bother you again....",-1
"M.L. Rose is a good place to throw a few beers back with dinner with friends with their large tables.  Their burgers are good but overpriced by at least 20%.  Why pay more for a burger here over the pharmacy or Burger Republic for more $$$ ?  They do have some TV's for sports too, but it's not the end all be all sports bar.  Overall not a bad place as they can cater to any crowd.",1
"This is the worst Hertz location. I rent a car once or twice a week for work and have been to a lot of Hertz locations. The customer service is poor, the car pick up location is inconvenient and the cars never have a full tank of gas. Let me share with you some lessons learned, which the Hertz people should tell you but don't:

1. Before you leave the rental counter, make sure you have a parking ticket to exit the garage.
2. I have never rented a car from this location with a full tank of gas. They tell you it has a ""little less than full"". How the heck do you return a car ""a little less than full""? I always end up filling up the tank for them because I don't know when to stop pumping. 
3. The cars used to be in the downstairs garage of 30th St station. Not anymore.  Go out the rental office and make a right, up the ramp until you find the escalator. Take escalator up. Walk across the overpass and take the escalators down. Leave the building and cross the walkway to the rental cars, which are outdoors. So, if it is raining or snowing, good luck.
4. Take parking ticket from lesson 1 to exit the parking area.
5. Upon return, just park in any spot and bring your keys back to the rental counter (back into the building, up the escalator, across the overpass, down the escalator, across the length of the station) to return the keys. Don't expect a verbal confirmation of your total, don't expect a smile or someone wishing you a good day. Just walk away vowing to take a cab the next time.",-1
"Emmanuelle is beautiful, from the walls, to the chandelier, to the drinks, to the bar set up, to the bathrooms. All of it.

I don't often write reviews this short, but that's all you need to know. There is nothing bad that can possibly be said. I wish this place was closer to where I live. 

Just, love.",1
"This place is a dirty hole.  Avoid it.
They have unfriendly service, crappy beer selection and they have no problems over serving the already inebriated customers.  
There is such a seedy element to this place. 
 In the span of 4 days, 2 men were attacked on the sidewalk after closing time.  
I have nothing against guys smoking weed, but the gauntlet of smokers that you have to wade through to get in or out of the bar is just gross. 
Ever notice how it's impossible to get a taxi to come to this bar?",-1
"OMG!! what a disappointment today was, I have been so excited to see Rembrandt's reopen after a few months of remodel, what I was thinking is that the new owners would want to do more restorations of this Beautiful, Cozy, old Church, maybe try to find more space to add Tables, but NO, I walked into a Modern, Cold, Hospital Coffee Shop, the Charm is gone, so so disappointed and sad, we all love the Charm of Eagle, but it seems to be fading fast, Please People talk to all the other Eagle Shop Owners when your visiting them especially the old Original Buildings to keep Eagle's charm and quaintness and restore these Beautiful Buildings.",-1
"Awesome food! But beware, do not order through grub hub, order directly from the restaurant website or call them! Grub hub placed my order as pick up after I specifically chose delivery! The restaurant had to re-make my food and get their own driver to bring me my food since I had no way of picking up.",-1
"We stopped here on our way through town and want sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. The service sucked and the staff was rude but the food made up that in the end. We had some pulled pork which was more chopped then pulled, brisket tacos which were define, and pulled chicken which was moist. The sides were pretty good too but nothing to write home about. There were five of us and our bill was close to $60 and one meal was a kids meal. I  really only have two complaints: One, they didn't have ribs for lunch and two, the bathrooms were filthy.",-1
"I had a horrible experience here. The waiter was great but as I got my appetizer, there was it has a hair in it.
Next the noodles came out mine was fine but my friend has a huge hair in his. I thought he was joking until he told me. After that it ruined my appetite, I gave the noodles back and they didn't even give me a new one, I thought I should've got the food for free at that point.. never eating here again",-1
"Just moved to the area and was excited to have our first Sunday morning breakfast downtown after church.  It was such a great morning and we happily sauntered a couple blocks over to Puckett's.  We were told there would be a 15 or 20 minute wait for a table for the two of us.  No problem.  It starts to be a problem when it's a half hour, there are empty tables AND people coming in after us have been seated.  OK, it's a beautiful day, we're happy to be here, it'll be fine.    No, no it wasn't...our server was very pleasant and kept our coffee cups filled but apologized several times over for the VERY long time our order took.  We finally got our order only to be disappointed in the food.  The delicious pancakes I was looking forward to were burnt on the bottom and our order of sausage gravy and biscuits mediocre at best.  Just so deflating all the around.  The server did take the pancakes off the bill which we appreciated but will probably look for other breakfast options next time.",-1
"uhhhh I hate to go to 3 on them because the first time I had them I thought wow what a cute little sushi bar with some pretty decent sushi in South Reno..  that being said.. Wow it is Saturday night @ 6:30pm and there is only one other couple here besides us.. the sushi chefs seemed real nice and asked what you would like as you were finishing instead of when you were completely  done which is a big plus. THEN as I am enjoying this nice little place with a very friendly staff I am thinking i am catching a wave of some thing bad smelling like cleaner... ummm still left over all enjoying the place :) 
came here again a month later and well can not give this place more then 3 now because we were Sat at the sushi bar right by the kitchen ( which is where they make the Chinese cuisine ( as this is a sushi / Chinese restaurant)  again a Saturday night at 6 and no one in there at all except for  my husband and I.. Umm  this means great service with 2 sushi chefs standing right there right? NO dead wrong they thought it  would be much better for them to stand there talking with each other while we waited 5 minutes before they even looked at us (hence this is at the sushi bar ) it took an hour for us to each get 4 rolls from our slow chef. then the over powering smell I smelt last time came pouring over us it was the smell of vinegar and I mean it smelt like they dumped a gallon right in front of us, I could not take it I had to force myself to walk away from my sushi and pay the bill and leave. I would not recommend them to a friend",-1
The food was tasty service not so good two of us got our plates then the third person then finally the fourth person and then after we asked we got our appetizers felt kind of rushed out of there a lot of money not a nice atmosphere,-1
"I once went to this Gavi and it was fine.  Second time though it was mostly empty, sat down, waited 15 minutes without service and left.  Haven't been going back and have been telling everyone I know not to go there.",-1
"Had an entire outdoor kitchen installed....started out great and quickly fell apart due to the installer. 
Now all the stainless steel drawers for accessories leak every time it rains....completely useless and a waste of money. I recommend going somewhere else.",-1
"This was my second time coming here. The first time was before I got into yelp so I can't really go into too much detail about that experience. I do remember enjoying it and the margaritas. Anyways, I came here recently on a Thursday night with a group of work people. We had a few issues making reservations. When we called we told them we are a party of about 10 and she said that she would have to double check and get back to us, which she never did. We called back and she said that she would have to check with the General Manager because they have quizzo on Thursday nights. We finally got reservations squared away though! And we got seated at two separate tables next to each other. 

My steak tacos were good, nothing special. The margaritas though... I enjoyed all 4 of them! For dessert I shared some dessert nachos those were pretty tasty. 

If you are going here with a large group definitely make reservations and they may need to split you up.",1
"I went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon and had a rather forgettable experience. This place looks like it would be a lot of fun with an outdoor seating area for live reggae music and a well-designed interior that that reminds you of the tropics. 
The prices are on the high side but the food itself is pretty good. The service is just god awful though. We waited 45 minutes from our initial order to get an order of bread  and a drink. It was another 20 minutes to get the actual entrees. The beef ribs and chicken jerk are authentic, reminded me of trips to Jamaica. The rice is so-so and the same for the cabbage and plantains and in my opinion, the coco bread isn't worth it. I would like to give this place a better rating because the point of going there was the jerk chicken but the service was terrible enough to make you regret going. 
That all being said, I'm planning on going to the live reggae shows they have and ordering take-out when the urge for jerk chicken arises.",-1
"Well, I have been here many times and this will be my last. I came here right when they opened at 11 a.m.  and was the second  person  in the restaurant to be seated . Previously, I came mostly for the fried clam strips as they're hard to find in Tucson but so delicious. Found out they don't serve them any longer so I decided to try the crab cakes. They were basically two balls of mushy breadcrumbs lacking in flavor I think I had about 3 chunks of crab. Service was extremely slow.  The restaurant got busy shortly after I arrived and I thought since I was the second person in the restaurant and I didn't have a complicated order I would be served quickly but that was not the case, several people that came in after me were served before me. Waitress was just ok.. not super friendly. Overall, not a very positive experience so I have no reason to come back.",-1
"Last night we tried to get into the oldest Italian Restaurant in South Philly. Thankfully, they couldn't fit us in, so our son said lets try Angelina's  so we walked around the corner and into a small Italian Restaurant.  Immediatly we felt at home.  Angelina is cooking in the front of the resaurant and her husband is servicing. There were 3 of us and we started off with Eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer.  One bite and we were hooked.  We ordered the Veal Osso Bocca, Carbonara and lasagna.  Everything was absolutly DELISH!!  Can't wait to go back!!!",1
"This was my first time at Panda Express. I found the workers there to be very pushy, trying to hurry me through the line. 

Let's get down to Brass tax, nuts and bolts. This is a buffet without the benefits of a buffet. Some Jabroni scoops out your portions and you can't go back up to feed your fat gob. 

The orange chicken and Kung pow chicken left me unsatisfied. It was cold and served on a paper plate #ew. 

Also they charge 1 dollar for an extra fortune cookie. That's right 1 dollar for a fortune cookie #greedyweasels",-1
"Got there mid-morning today, the early rush was over. Two tables were full, each with three people. The family in one of the tables had just walked in ahead of me, so they were being attended to first. Still, I was immediately welcomed, and in a couple of minutes a friendly lady brought the breakfast menu and asked if I wanted coffee. A cup appeared a few moments later, and was kept full throughout my visit. Radio playing golden oldies from the 70s, my kind of music. The ham omelet with home fries and toast arrive a few minutes later, worth waiting for. Done just right and kept me filled for hours. A friendly family restaurant where you feel welcome and appreciated, just north of Gulfport.",1
"Went there to see the Nashville Yacht Club Band with some friends, had a great time. The atmosphere was perfect, I love the open bar and pool area connected. The bartenders name was Eckhard and he really made the experience worthwhile. I could tell they were understaffed and no one payed me any attention for at least 5 minutes. Then, he not only completes my order but creates a perfect cocktail just for me. That's what I expect in a hotel atmosphere. Will return again only to have Eckhard make me some hangin drinks!!",1
"This has to be one of the strangest business decisions ever. Take your very popular B-B-Q joint at the corner of 12th and Porter and move it to a totally out of the way, falling down, probably-soon-to-be-demolished minor league baseball stadium.  WHAT?!?!?  Was this the only space available after Whitt's opened their location at the airport 's C-Concourse? I mean seriously, I was so bummed to hear that they moved here. (If  you can't tell.)

Anyway, the food is generally good. The tamales are bland and gluey. The brisket is highly recommended. The diablo beans should be avoided if you don't have an office with a door that you can close.",1
"The food was good, but not great.....but the service was absolutely awful. They really weren't all that busy, so, it was surprising that our server literally only came over a couple of times during our 90 minute lunch. Had to walk up to the bar for my second drink.....and again to get a to-go cup. In addition, we were shocked that they charged us $14.50 for a coffee with 1 shot of Bailey's! The rest of the prices weren't bad....this one just came out of left field! 

They had an APPLE PIE TINI listed as their drink special and it was fantastic! Trust me, it's not some dainty drink in a martini glass.....it's a 16oz glass of straight vanilla/cinnamon/apple whiskey! Give it a shot!!",-1
"Two stars: I'd come back only if I was too lazy to drive 15 miles to the other endless hibachi. 

Came in for lunch. When you sit down, the ambient light level is dark. I mean like I'm on a date and I don't want to see my date clearly kind of ambient light.  And it's pretty bright outside when I came in, so to go from sunny day to candle-light level is odd.

You have the choice of choosing all-you-can-eat or a la carte, but the whole party must choose one or the other, there are no split types.

They have two hibachi stations in the front to accomodate parties of ten or if you opted for the tableside show, which is something I guess they do.  

Our waitress did get some of our orders mixed up in the sushi department, or missing some orders. 

The my steak and shrimp hibachi (the endless one, not the tableside one), surprisingly came out moist and not dry, which rarely is the case with these AYCE places. 

Price is not bad, but then again the selection also felt limited too, compared to other places I've been.",-1
"This place quite simply has the best pho I've ever tasted, and I have had it all over the city. The crab rangoons were also pretty spectacular.  Other than that,  the service was prompt and accurate, despite the fact that the dining room quite literally was completely full within 10 minutes of our arrival. If you are looking for a quick, non-pretenious Vietnamese restaurant, this is the place for you.",1
Yelp states that you close at 1800 (6pm) but your answering machine says that you close at 1730 (530pm). Which is accurate?,-1
"It is sad but seemingly true that this place has survived for years on the overflow traffic from some of the other places at John's Pass. Tired of the wait at Bubba Gump? Not in the mood for pizza from Delosa's? Just realized that you paid for parking and that Walt'z has closed for the day - plus your feet hurt from a day at the beach ... stop for a while at Sculley's and take what they serve you. If you can find a server, that is. 

Actually, the service isn't that bad ... the problem is with the layout of the place. The shops here want to have an eclectic air, as though they were built from driftwood and shipping crates held together with sail cloth and rope. This is fine in fantasy, but in reality does not make it easy for the wait staff to get around easily of remain within eye sight of their tables. 

The food is passable, but unexceptional. Being a stone throw away from Gulf of Mexico means that a restaurant can lean towards basic tourist fare (they likely won't know how boring it is) and get away with it. Locals tend to shy away from such places, unless they are entertaining out-of-townees who believe boat drinks and breezes are more important than fine dining.",-1
"In NO on business, and always try to eat where the locals do, or at least avoid the chains. This place came highly recommended. I was all set for a great breakfast, and was so disappointed. Took 30 minutes to get food, which was overcooked after sitting under heat lamps. Totally uninterested and full of attitude service. They were busy, so may have something to do with it, but I won't be back.",-1
"I cannot thank this Dobb's enough! Especially Keith. They did not carry the brand of tire on my car (Hankook) so he ordered it via courier as I needed my car fix the same day. When I had my car towed to their location, it was immediately serviced and I was in and out in about 30 minutes. Many thanks to Dobb's & Keith! Lifesavers.",1
Came down here for some of their tasty fish tacos to find out that they have closed this location.,-1
"If you want to know the definition of customer service come to this place. No matter the industry, the customer service here shines.  I have been coming here for a while now and they never disappoint.",1
"I'm pretty impressed with their customer service. I got a call from Brock today after ordering yesterday. It was probably a call to ""up sell"" but I really didn't need anything right now.He was pleasant and we shared a laugh. I also got an email that let me know when I would get my order, etc.  I will keep them in mind for future orders. 

I just ordered a pizza stone for personal use. This was the cheapest online.",1
Went here after another restaurant in the area didn't serve us in a timely matter. They sat us right down and it was not very busy around lunch time. Food was good but it took a long time to get it out and the place was dead.,-1
"I really wanted bagel and lox but they were out of bagels so I opted for the lox eggs Benedict. It came out with the lox fried! Yuck! Since I won't send anything back unless it is inedible I lived with it. I just don't understand frying lox. Who does that?  Otherwise this is a good diner with attentive wait staff but I just can't get past the fried lox.  Lox, by definition, are not cooked but smoked only. If it is going to be fried, then it's just salmon.",1
"I have had slight tightness, sore lower back..& i didn't want it to progress into herniated discs...so I Was referred to This practice & a Dr. Patrick Donahue.My 1st time ...so He looked familiar as he goes to my gym.Nice guy, early 30's..he asked me 1st  time,And I said YES, "" are you apprehensive?"" I said, Oh no..love getting my back cracked!!! LOL He said well..being your in shape..it wont bother you. He put these sensors on my back felt like 1,000 fingers loosening me up for approx. 10-15 min..it was great! then took me to another room..for the Cracking to commence.  he told me my pelvis bone was off, one side sat higher, other lower, this made one leg shorter then the other, as it protects the nerves, when its off, why I was feeling the tightness & soreness in lower lumber. After the session, he told me be tender & sore..but like all things my body getting used to it. Going again tonight -Yeah Back!!!.",1
"I went with a friend yesterday for a birthday lunch.We got there mid-afternoon and were seated right away. They were still serving their brunch menu and i was slightly disappointed because most of it consisted of breakfast foods, of which I wasn't really in the mood for.  The food was pretty good though. I got the grilled cheese and tomato soup which was quite good. However we felt that the service was definitely lacking. Everyone was very nice but our waitress was MIA most of the time. I asked for a re-fill on my water and that took like 10-15 minutes only after I asked again did I get it. It wasn't just that though, that actually wasn't even that big of deal to me. SHe checked on us once and then disappeared the rest of the time. When we had finished eating  she was no where to be found. We literally sat there with our finished plates for about 15 minutes and i would attribute it to being busy but it wasn't even busy because at that point we were literally the only ones in the section we were in, and there was only a handful of people in the restaurant itself. We had to call over a staff member to get our waitress  and they ended up just getting our check for us and making up some lame excuse about our server doing some type of stock in the basement. If that was really the case though why didn't anyone else cover her table? It was obvious that we were finished for some time and looking around for our waitress and like 4 different staff members walked by our table at least 5 times. Overall the food was good and everyone was friendly but the service itself left something to be desired...I just felt like there was no excuse because it wasn't at all crowded.",-1
"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to St. Pete a few weeks ago. I'm not disappointed or wowed, but I will take a few more trips to this place to give a more comprehensive review. 

They have a decent assortment of sandwiches, bagels and donuts. I can tell the bagels are made fresh, which is a plus. I was really excited to see they have lox cream cheese so I got that on an onion bagel. It was good, but nothing special. The cream cheese was not pack with flavor and I have had better bagels elsewhere in the area.

Also the donuts look good and taste average as well. I got a plain yeast which was light in sweetness and texture. Though, it kind of reminded me of the ones you can get at a grocery store. 

Overall there prices are pretty good though. My ice coffee, bagel w/ cream cheese and donut order came to $5.45",1
"The pho is abysmal. There is no flavor to it; it literally tastes like boiled water. The noodles were clumped together when the bowl got to me, which means they didn't make the noddles fresh, but they've been sitting around for some time. The meat used in the pho is was chewy.",-1
"This hotel seems very nice in the lobby, but the rooms are sub-par. Ours was located on the 5th floors right next to the elevator with a very small window overlooking the court yard. It smelled like a basement. The only positive things I can say was the pillows were fantastic and the lady who came for turn down service was very sweet. 
I think this hotel needs to instill some sort of quiet hours if it wants to set themselves in the genre of classy. Having drunk frat guys making there presence know at all hours of the night is ridiculous. 
I also found out after our stay that my husband had requested a bottle of champagne to the room that was never brought. When he questioned it at check out the lady at the front desk was very rude and dismissive. 
I will never stay here again and I will recommend to my friends the same.",-1
"I was in town on business and feeling on the edge of a cold and I was really looking forward to a healthy salad, but unfortunately I didn't have the best experience. I ordered the Chopped Med Salad and there was so much oily dressing that it leaked through the take out bag and puddled at the bottom. The menu also indicated it had greens, but in fact it was on a bed of iceberg, which I find a bit shocking for a vegetarian restaurant. Where is the nutrition value in that? The only plus was getting a free (tasty) lemonade because I checked in on FourSquare. Overall I found it bland, boring and uninspired for a veggie place.",-1
Wow. Wow. We've been trying to go here for a while and for some reason or another it hasn't happened. We used our access card and walked there last night and I must say this is one of the best meals I've had in awhile. For Italian food..... the best I've had forever which is a long time. We will be coming back. Deep fried ravioli appetizer. We had chicken alfredo and eggplant Parmesan for entrees. She ordered a glass of wine that was $10 that we did realize we could buy the bottle for $11 later. Which is fine I understand. When we come back we will be served by Mario because he is the best.,1
Best breakfast in West!!!! The chicken & waffles never disappoint and neither does the service. I only wish they were open  at 2am so I can get pancakes after dancing at Dahlak.,1
BEWARE! The shot girls steal from you. She came up to me and fed me 2 shots while we were dancing. Only then did she proceed to tell me it would be $8. She took my $10 bill and never returned with change. She disappeared and the bartender didn't give me a refund. She claimed she didn't know anything about what the shot girls do. I got in an argument with her and was thrown out.,-1
"So. I do love this place; the atmosphere is fun, I like the decorating it really fits the theme, the burgers are fantastic and varying options for flavor profiles are vast.

I really would love to give Bailey's Range 4 stars however given that they're a burger establishment there is NO excuse to overcook a burger...let alone TWICE in a row.

I ordered 'medium rare' I got well done....umm what? I sent it back and it came back very medium but edging towards medium well...sigh. Unacceptable that a place like this doesn't have a cook(s) who can cook a burger to order.  I'd like to add that everybody else at our table who ordered medium also had theirs basically well done. (Table of 8)

I'd love a response from someone on this, I just can't wrap my head around such a amateur problem.",-1
"I tried a dog with bacon wrapped around it, all the toppings.  It was tasty.  Next time I think I'd like to try the bacon dog without all the extra-stuff on top.  The restaurant has the feel of a college bar.  It's dark with loud music video's playing on several TV's hung from the ceiling.  The staff was friendly.  The flan was superb but needed more sauce.  The parking lot is smallish and a little hard to turn into if someone is on the way out at the same time.  The handicapped parking spots are poorly positioned and should be moved closer to the entrance.",1
"I give this three stars because of the service.

We went there on a Wednesday night and it just so happened to be 2-4-1 on select bottles, spirits, and specialty drinks. They were busy so I understood the fact that nobody had greeted us right away. 10 minutes later someone said they would be right with us as they were walking past. Another 10 minutes went by and our drink order was finally taken and we put in an app order as well. Our app arrived in a decent amount of time, and it was delicious. We had the Pierogies, which my boyfriend had never tried and I grew up eating. Our server never stopped by until after the empty plate had been sitting there for awhile. When she finally came back by we ordered our entrees. I had the Basket of Crispy Little Fish while my boyfriend had the Farmer Rays Grilled Vegetable Muffuletta. The fish were very tender and it came with some very yummy sweet potato fries. The muffuletta came with some house chips that were great. 
  We were almost done with our meal and thought about ordering another beer, but our waitress was too busy to stop by the table. While I was in the bathroom my boyfriend stopped her to ask for some waters and to hear about the dessert menu. She told him she could tell us the dessert specials as they did not have a dessert menu, and would wait until I came back. About 20 minutes after I came back she finally stopped by. Water glasses empty and asked if we still wanted to know about the dessert. We told her we were still interested and chose the DIY smores. The smores were a fun little dessert. They bring you marshmallows, graham crackers, strawberries, hershey's chocolate and reese's peanut butter cups. Its also very messy. We had to grab napkins off a near by table because she had taken all of ours away.

Overall, the food was great! The service however, was less than desirable. I'll give this place another shot and hope they redeem themselves next time.",-1
"Took awhile for me to get service from the people working because they were busy talking in the back so that made me kinda annoyed, but other then that it was a good meal..Nothing really special.",-1
"So I have been here multiple times becuase it is close to my work and some of my coworkers love the wings here.  On each occassion I have tried different things and the only thing I really like here are the croutons that come on the salad. 

The wings are OK - I've only gotten them with buffalo sauce not the sybergs sauce.  They seem like they are over cooked - the chicken just isn't moist like it I've had at other locations.  The gumbo is GROSS...it smelled and tasted fishy which I wasn't expecting since it was called a Chicken Gumbo.  I had one bite and left the rest.

If you are a crouton fanatic then come here, order a salad, and ask for extra croutons.  Other than that...I would pass.",-1
"Not only was the driver reckless and erratic in his driving (I had my three-year-old with me, and he was turning corners like we were in a Hollywood car chase), he blasted vile right-wing propaganda--i.e. Sean Hannity--at earsplitting volume right behind my head the whole way. By the time we arrived at our destination, my blood pressure was off the scale. If you want tips and repeat business, DO NOT torture your passengers.",-1
Cantina has hosted several of our Breakthrough Network business mixers and they do a super job. We pack the place with over 150 people during the mixer. The service is great and they work closely with our team to make our events a huge success.,1
"This five stars is for the only sandwich I've ever gotten here, which happens to be the Cajun BLT. I have since told every person who visits STL to eat here and get this sandwich, and they have done so and also admitted it was at least in their top five.

Every new convert to the Church of the Cajun BLT feels like a personal victory.",1
"The blue crabs were on point. Never had crab nachos before but great first time. Service was ok at best, but maybe our waitress was having a bad day. But the bartenders were cool.",1
"Love Nails turned my frown upside down. My fiance and I walked in here after a bad experience at Westchase Nails across the street and I told host that I didn't care how long the wait is that I wanted the best nail technician to do my fill in and I told her I was getting married this week and wanted my nails to look perfect and that I was not taken good care of next door. She said we are on it and we will take great care of you two. So they immediately got us back and Katie was my technician and Nina was my fiance Gregs technician. I wanted her to just clean his cuticles up for the close up shots of our wedding bands. They both took such great care of us and gave us complimentary wine! We had such a great time and my nails have never looked better. I have found my home nail salon, the salon is so beautiful and so customer service oriented, you are greeted with a smile right off the bat. Thanks Love Nails for being so great to us!",1
"Ordered the full slab for $26 expecting the meal to feed at least four people. 
Although the meat was plentiful, it comes dry with a small container of BBQ sauce. 
You run out of sauce about a quarter of the way through even if you are being stingy with it. Also comes with beans and toast but only enough for one person. 
Won't be coming back. 
We have way better BBQ here in Tucson and much closer too.",-1
"Wow got in time before closing . I had the corn beef Reuben. But I choose not to have the sauerkraut with 1000 Island dressing. On rye. It came with chips but I added a up charge for a nice small salad . No tomatoes my choice.  Unfortunately the rye bread was burnt. I would have never served it. She didn't even ask if it's to well down BURNT. But o did eat the beef which was tasty
G had the philly cheese steak. It had onions no peppers 
It has a great outside deck great view of the waterways. 
But besides that we won't be going back",-1
"So as an automotive shop owner I have customers ask all the time can you have my car detailed. Well I have to say after having Chuck do a few cars for customers and seeing the glee in their eyes when they see the job, I have to say he is amazing. Now add his great detail services along with the amazing job he does for me weekly between my wives car and my dually I am a very satisfied customer!!! Between a black SUV and a 4 door long bed dually that nobody likes to wash, Chuck puts a smile on my face every time I see him. Do yourself and your car a big favor call Chuck. Remember the sign of a great business is they are busy and the price is the price, somebody willing to cut corners and make deals does it because they need to!!! Chuck is fairly priced and amazing at what he does!!! You won't be disappointed.",1
"Best pizza ever... hands down.

Love the peeps running the place - former hockey player (ask him to pop his nose) and adorable, but tough as nails wife... very funny.

They make their own sausage and mozzarella here.  And God help you if you mispronounce Ricotta!!

Any of the pizzas are fab... we even eat the crusts - which is a rarity in our family.  Just dab it in the olive oil, and mayb ask for some of their viniagrette to dip too!",1
"Well if this isn't the most over rated place ever, I don't know what is.  It almost makes me want to open a restaurant just to watch everyone flock to it and take their money, and shut down just as the fad dies.  And I don't mean years later, when I start cutting corners and offering smaller portions and jacking prices while the service swan-dives...no, I'm talking about the minute a line 30 people deep, waiting for OK food vanishes.

Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is just fine if you want mediocre brothy soup embellished with garlic or spice, decorated with half a hard boiled egg.  Is this really the trend?  It must be, because people line up to stand outside on Speedway next door to May's Chicken and Waffles.  I can't understand this - given the choice between waiting for 25 minutes for soup vs. no wait for chicken/waffles/burgers, I'm going next door from now on.

Small restaurant.  No outside seating.  Very reminiscent of Sweets Raku in Vegas, long lines for Costco desserts.

Food OK.  Tried the vegetarian and pork ramen as well as the miso.  Tasty - NOT WORTH $12 - NOT WORTH 30 MINUTE WAIT.

For the love of the Yelp God, go eat some Pho.  Easily twice as filling, about $3 less expensive, and NO 30 MINUTE WAIT!!!",-1
"Free Wi-Fi and standard Cosi food and prices should put this place at a 4 star - but the gruff service was a bit of a put off. On the other hand, the food came in 3 minutes and they got my order right, so it's hard to complain. But seriously, just smile once in a while! At least one person on the staff!

On a side note, they have plenty of seating in the café - a rarity for food options in the station.",1
"I just got a manicure, which turned out really well.  The shop is really well decorated, super cute! The tables have heat lamps built into them, and one for your feet as well.  They have plenty of colors for nails in gel and regular. 

The only thing I didn't like was the pushing of other services. I was offered a polish change on my toes, gel polish, eyebrow wax (mine are so blonde you cant see them), and even a haircut. (After I mentioned I got my hair cut yesterday. 

Needless to say, I will return.",1
"My husband and I came to this Bully's to watch the Nevada Wolfpack vs. Texas Tech football game on September 24th and before the 3rd quarter was over the bar replaced almost every TV with UFC. I understand the bar paid for the pay-per-view, but if they had mentioned this to us we would have sat at a location with a television bigger than the piece of crap tiny TV we are now in front of, and that was in HD, or we would have gone to a different sports bar. Plus for the second time in a row the service was horrendous.  You just lost a customer Bully's. Congratulations.",-1
"Paid for Deluxe Services almost 2 months prior to the event and only received a basic package at best. Attempts to resolve the issue with Keith have been returned with defensive dialogue, accusatory statements and untruths. His unprofessional approach has escalated this situation to the point of being settled in court. I have never been treated so poorly by a vendor.",-1
"We went to Burger Up for the first time recently during a trip to Nashville. I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was pretty good, but the fries were cold. Not warm at all. I would have sent them back but the wait itself for the food was a bit much, didn't want to wait longer for warm fries. My husband asked for ketchup for his fries but the waiter forgot it. My husband liked his burger.",-1
I went in today because of neck and shoulder pain. Marisa was awesome. I've never experienced a massage like this before. She did a deep tissue massage and stretched my body as well. I already feel better and it's 5 hours later. I'm definitely going back to her soon!,1
"It was fun, but some parts werent as scary as others. I believe that if they changed it up a little bit, it could be great. However, towards the end of the walk through the woods there is one girl that yells so loud that it rings your ears. She has worked there both this year and last year and gets so close to you to scream in your ear. She is my only bad complaint about it.",1
Ordered a medium well burger. Came out medium rare. Ate the edges. Waitress apologized but didn't offer a thing.,-1
Wasn't impressed. My friend got a terrible tattoo there.Maybe that's why its so far away from town.vape and tattoo? I hear vaping is not allowed in tattoo shops. Hack artists trying to pretend tattoo.,-1
"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for this place yet. But it's now or never!

My family and I were born in Guatemala. I was raised there during my youngster years, but pretty much grew up in New Orleans. I go back to visit my family in Guatemala quite frequently, and there's nothing like a good ole Tres Leches or Arroz con Leche when I go ""home"". 

I can't remember how long ago it was that my family and I discovered this place, but I remember coming home and seeing a tres leches in the refrigerator and just the fact that I saw that cake in AMERICA was like finding a pot of gold with a leprechaun standing next to it. I was so thrilled! Honestly, at that very moment, I didn't care where it came from. I just wanted to eat it... well, then I finished it and I had to go buy another one before daddy saw that I ate the whole cake. 

My mom told me where the bakery was. I think I drove up and down the street like 5 times before I saw it. It's so small... but my goodness, great things come in small packages. My parent's home is in Kenner, so it's less than 10 minutes from their house. Very conveniently located in my case. Now that I live uptown, I wish I could find a place like this in my area. But until then, stop by Normas and get yourself a Tres Leches! You won't regret it!",1
"Nice location. I had a really nice drink that I wish I could recall the name of. The pretzels are great and the beer cheese is really, really good. Our server was attentive initially but it took a while for our pretzels to come out, we came here because we had to wait four our table at Cosimo's so we thought we would have drinks & appetizers & kill time till our table was ready. It took the pretzels so long to come out that we had to tell them to make them to-go because we had received our page from the restaurant. We ended up eating our pretzels later that night as a snack.",1
"Ive been to the sherwood park location and love it. However when plates closed down i was excited to see sumo sumo open in edmonton! Sumo sumo is one of my fave sushi spots. 

My review on the calgary trail location:

Walking in -there was not one person at the front to host and welcome you to the restaurant...this is bery bizarre ..it took about 5 minutes to get someone to seat us.
First no one was there..second a lady came in right after us and she ordered takeout..so when the host came to the front she helped her first! Even though she was behind us! Very unreal!

Second thr decor was not changed from plates to sumo sumo which is fine as it is all new and nice but its a very dark atmosphere in that building..they need some sky lights or something. Sumo sump swp is alot cozier and bright with a nice japanese style decor feel. This spot is a little more basic. Too open. 

The service is average. Had to ask for green tea over and over again.. it should be filled often.

Parking is very easy 10/10

Sashmi is excellent came out on time fresh abd very tasty A tad pricey though!

Maki rolls are unreal! Alot if flavour! Same thing a tad pricey ..for the great rolls its around 14-16 dollars for 6 pieces.. for the average rolls you can chose 4 pieces or 8 pieces and its 8 dollars or 16 dollars for most. Menu is online for more accuracy. 

The platter with ribs, camalari and chicken karrage is disgusting. Tastes all like deep fried fat. And the karrage isnt even karrage ..its not crunchy its really chewy and the ribs have zero meat on them..they came with three dips that werent very flavourful i would not recommend ordering that. 

Id recommend going to the buffet to save money and get your sushi fix instead of going at night ..we had 4 different rolls and 12 piece sashimi and the combo plate ...camr out over 100 dollars (no alcohol)",1
"A perfectly fine ""one dollar sign"" hotel. My room was very clean, furnishings were simple but not ugly. Room has a coffee maker, hair dryer, tiny fridge and tiny microwave. Parking near the rooms. The only problem is the walls are thin, we could hear the tv in the next room.",1
"Terrible, terrible service. Entitled hipsters who confuse orders, give attitude, and ruin customer's experience. The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason, but blared close to full volume. Softer, more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too, they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.

Customers are mostly Penn students, business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons. 

Gelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it, but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me, they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change.",-1
"I loved coming here when it was in the old location with my mother. Delicious food. The manicotti is creamy, not dry and flaky cheese like most places these days. Since they moved I have come whenever I was down to visit. 

This review is not about food, which is very good, but customer service. I came in a few minutes after closing, with people being served plates, just starting to dig in, not looking like they would leave any time soon. 

They wouldn't seat me. They wouldn't even do take out. I had wanted the special. They probably could have scooped it from the tray. No fuss no muss. I only get here twice a year now. 

Not even take out? Really? Guess business is great.",-1
"Terrible service!! Automatically charge you 18% tips even though we only have 3 people?? Staffs are so rude when I confronted them about it. This is illegal. I don't mind tipping if the service is good but it is not right when they automatically apply it to a small party plus the service wasn't even great, our server was rude. Won't be coming back. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.",-1
"I've been getting Brazilian waxes from Vanessa for two years now, I followed her to Selah. No wax in that area is completely painless, but Vanessa is patient and professional while making you feel comfortable throughout the process. I have never had a bad result in waxes with her, and I've gotten brows, Brazilian, legs, and underarms done. The price is reasonable and so worth the quality of the service. 

Selah is a beautiful shop and the ladies I encounter there are always friendly and welcoming. If you're going to spend the money on a wax service, there is no better place than Selah.",1
"The food here was very good, but there are certainly some imperfections.

DOWNSIDES:

First off, keep in mind that this place is far more American than Japanese. Creative nonetheless, but it is far from authentic. There is a lot of grease and frying invoked.

The big downside to this establishment is the pricing. Some dishes were ridiculously small and simple for the price. Granted, this is a kind of tapas restaurant, but some of the dishes should be taken off the menu if they're going to charge these prices. There was a dish with a few cubes beets, and it was five dollars. They just tasted like beets, nothing more. Very disappointing. This was only one of the many overly simple dishes that are $5+

The service was also rather slow. It took 10 minutes for each small plate to arrive. In addition to this, the music was extremely loud and distracting, and the lighting was much too dim.

Another downside to this place was the lack of vegetarian options. Everything either had pieces of pork belly, or was fried in duck fat and whatnot. 

UPSIDES:

But I will say that their vegetarian ramen was out of this world. It was kind of misleading though because there was no broth; it was more of a thick coconut curry with noodles. Extremely tasty nonetheless.

The Spicy Shrimp Gyoza (dumplings) was also incredible. They were very well seasoned and flavorful.

All in all, we spent around $120 for a party of three, and were still a bit hungry. But if you have the money, the food here is very good. We might be back for a special occasion.",1
"I ordered a last minute pumpkin pie for pick up the next morning, and it was not a problem for them.  The pie was ready when I showed up and delicious.  I had forgotten about this little gem, and when I walked in I wanted to buy all the treats they had on display - they were beautiful!  I think their pricing is beyond fair for their quality product.  

Just a heads up on the phone orders - you must pay over the phone, not when you pick up.",1
Don't have much negative to say. Family ate here before our first lightning game and everyone enjoyed the meal. We are partial to Mexican cuisine and it didn't disappoint although offering complimentary chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant in the US would have been nice.,1
"My daughter and I ate here for the first time yesterday... She didn't want to wait the 5 to 15 minutes to be seated and was like mom can you take me to IHOP.. Uugh no.. When I tell you the food and service was THEE BEST!!! We will be back...Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",1
"After trying twice unsuccessfully to get there early enough to get a meal within 20 minutes, I finally was able to break away from work and was 5th in line. I had heard of the ""food truck nazi"" and that it was the best in town and found Gus, the falafel nazi, as he called himself, lived up to his reputation and more. 
As my turn came up, I approached the cart tenuously, for I did not want to blow it by asking too many questions. He immediately recognized me as a new customer and told me all about the fresh ingredients he uses.
Chicken is cooked over coal and was tender on the inside and perfectly cooked on the outside. Falafel was delicious, as were the grapes and his homemade pasta that went along with it.
There was enough food for 2 people.
Well worth the wait!",1
"My experience with Kehoe was overwhelmingly negative, so much so that I joined Yelp to write about it. I was overcharged, and the check-out person was incredibly rude. 

In response to the original review, I received an apology and partial refund, which is nice (ignoring the creepiness factor of that). 

I would not go to Kehoe again, even if my car died in front of their lot, but I hope others have a better experience.",-1
"This is a light yet very filling alternative to surrounding locations. And they're accommodating to a paleo diet all you have to do is bring in your own additions or replacements - like almond/cashew butter. 

The prep area is wide open so you can watch while they make your bowl. They use very fresh ingredients that are cut up at order or minutes before.

Tip: This isn't something I'd recommend you order on the go unless you eat it right away. It'll lose some of it's nutritional value if you don't eat once received.",1
Place for latest night eats around and drive through is a must. New menu items and some veggie options etc. forgot to put my dessert order in the bag though so I was very bummed when I noticed far too late!,-1
"The place is impeccably clean and the services was very friendly. I was so looking forward to having some good Indian food, but this place was a big disappointment. It says fast-food Indian food, but it basically was like eating frozen Indian food that had been warmed up in the microwave. I'll keep looking.",1
"Such great burgers. And the slaw that comes with - YUM! So refreshing in that light dressing. 

I was almost going to rate this a 3-star, because our server was half asleep the whole night, but I understand some people have rough days/nights. No biggie. Was good enough for 4. Can't wait to come back for brunch!",1
"Pros:

-Superb cheeseburger - thick, evenly cooked, (almost) medium rare, nice sauce, soft bun
-Tasty (complimentary) zucchini bread
-Good service
-Good G+T selection
-Cool ambience
-Downstairs from my apartment

Cons:

-Expensive
-Per wife, the waitress ""seemed disappointed"" that we only ordered cheeseburgers (this was not verified, status as a ""con"" is under review)

Looking forward to going back.",1
"We never got the oysters that we ordered before our entrees. When our entrees came they were far too salty to eat. As former residents of Belgium we were not impressed at all with the food. We were offered dessert to apologize for the oysters but honestly with so many other restaurant options in NOLA we still will not be back.

The cocktails, however, were good so maybe happy hour would be decent but again, I unfortunately can't comment on the oysters.",-1
"Pretty good bagels, be sure to ask for extra cream cheese if you like a lot. The people are always pleasant which is unique to Dunedin. The bad thing is the guy doesn't wash his hands or wear gloves. He took a previous customers money, my money,  used the phone and wiped his nose, then he made my bagel. I won't go back. If this doesn't bother you, the bagels are pretty good.",1
"Visited Revolucion for the first time last night. The immediate reaction upon entering is super cool! A comfy place to hang. The music was a hit and the smells from the kitchen were enticing. Having said that - our first (and only) round of drinks took approx. 25min to arrive after ordering. the chips and salsa beat the drinks to the table. We ordered 5 house margaritas and two cans of beer. I think those should be easily turned out and easy to deliver in a much more timely manner.
I hear awesome things about the garden tiki patio I hope to give this place a second chance in the summer. Maybe with more servers on staff the timeliness of our experience will improve.
**ps the bathrooms are great - the fragrance used in there is a wonderful attention to detail. seems like a silly thing to mention in a review - but I challenge you to check it out!",-1
"We went here hoping for a good breakfast,  and we weren't disappointed.  We went on Valentine's Day, not because we wanted to, but because we had to.  In doing so,  we knew the wait would be long, which it was (an hour and a half), though i hear there's always a wait. 

The place is buzzing with servers and busboys. The tables around the edges of the room are a bit close to one another,  so seating is tight.  The service was though, considering how busy it was.  I ordered the famed cornmeal pancakes with a side of hash browns and a fried egg.  My girlfriend ordered the banana pancakes with a side of bacon.  Everything was amazing.  The pancakes were hearty but fluffy... The side of bacon only comes with three pieces which is disappointing,  but it was cooked to her liking.  The cornmeal pancakes had just the right amount of everything... Bacon,  peppers... Salsa, sour cream,  syrup... Yes,  all of that.  If you're looking for good coffee,  this is not the place, which was surprising. 

The only question is do you go with the homemade syrup or the maple.... Or both",1
"I haven't been here since before I could drive so I had no idea what I was getting into ha. But the process is super easy. 1-Parking! You can park for free in their parking garage and then take the sky bridge over into the museum. 2-tickets! You can buy online or there. 3- the museum! There are four or fiveish levels with different activities per floor. There's anywhere from mummies and dinosaurs to culture and science to a chocolate slide. Almost everything is free, the carousel costa a dollar to ride and you have to get a token out of a machine. But of course it's crazy full of kids and parents and learning. We went during a weekday and it wasn't too crazy. Makes for a very fun 3-4 hours running around.",1
"A much better tour than Miller Coors but still too big and way too long. Although it was cool to see some clydesdales up close, I could've done without the 20 minutes in their barn. 
If you're interesting in brewing beer, I'd say the tour is actually quite informative. Unlike Miller where they mark off how many drinks you've ordered, Busch is a little more lax. Although you're technically only allowed 2 beers each, they don't use tickets or markers so it's quite easy to sneak in a few more samples.",1
"I thought it was a good stay and spa visit after purchasing a ""customer appreciation"" deal with two nights and other credits and discounts. I get the bill and find they still charge for the room and tried to charge me twice for a beverage in the room. The beverage charge was handled but the voucher was a scam and didn't include the room cost at all. I will spread the word and never come back. So much for a good first stay experience. The lady on the phone even gave me attitude. Note: I read the fine print three times or more to avoid this.",-1
"Two stars for poor service.  Our server had zero product knowledge.  I ordered the sweet potato and cauliflower steak gratin.  She gave me a blank stare and did not seem to know what the heck that was.  I had to show her the item on the menu before she caught on.  My husband ordered the classic burger.  The side choices were French fries, loaded potato salad and gremolata chips.  He asked her what was in the loaded potato salad and she couldn't get past potatoes and mayonnaise.  Duh!!!! Potatoes.  Really?  He thought he'd be pressing his luck asking about gremolata, so he got the fries.  My gratin was amazingly tasty.  His burger was good but a bit overpriced at $15 even if the fries did come in an adorable little fryer basket! 

I do not know if her lack of knowledge was her fault or a failure on the part of management to train staff, but it resulted in the tip-o-meter hitting its lower end.  I would try a few more things in spite of high prices but not if she was my server again.",-1
"My friends and I went here one time for margaritas, and we sat outside. We were charged a $5 cover, and I have literally NEVER encountered as horrible service as I have at Copa. After we got drinks we didn't see the waitress again. We actually had to go inside to close our tab.",-1
"I can't give a lower rating, asked for very simple by the menu orders, two burgers in the two for five deal and one value meal burger and the two for five burgers were both not only wrong (different burgers) but the buns were stale and each one only had some of the toppings and one was missing a meat patty ( supposed to be a double). The value meal burger was supposed to be a double with bacon and BBQ sauce. Was given a single plain cheeseburger. They got the drinks right and the fries were the wrong size so basically we were overcharged for everything. There was no line and no one behind us so they weren't even busy. Avoid this location.",-1
There's been three times that I've ordered a green tea lemonade and got a peach tea lemonade and had to turn all the way back and go inside and have theme remake it.,-1
"This place is the best!  Not only are the baby backs the best of any in the area (that's what I order every time; I see no reason to try anything else on the menu), the staff is the friendliest and most attentive. I just ordered carryout & picked it up from the carryout area. Casey took my order and also delivered it to my car. Her attentiveness, courtesy and service from the time she answered the phone (she had to describe several side orders to me) until the time she delivered my food was exceptional. Thanks, Casey!",1
"Honestly, I don't know what all the hype is about. I went with a friend for lunch and ordered the lobster tail special.  There was so little meat and it was dry and rubbery. I also ordered the lobster bisque which tasted like it came right out of a Campbell's creme of chicken soup can. It was also not the greatest experience because 2 workers were arguing loudly at the front of the store. Maybe it was just a bad day, but all I know is that I won't be going back!",-1
"I can't say enough about Anthony and Johnathan as a woman I felt comfortable there, they didn't try to sell me anything that I didn't need, I dropped my car off at 7:30 and at 10:00 I got an email that it was ready!!! they had gave me a courtesy ride to my husbands job in the area, and came back and got me!!! the prices were reasonable and I would definitely do business with them again ",1
"The pizza is subpar at best. The owner was a douche bag to my brother. We asked for a box and an employee told us his boxes are trash and pizza is quality. Lol what?! Well let me tell you. Size doesn't matter. His pizza is trash. Like his 50 cent boxes. FIGHT THE URGE AND GO ELSEWHERE!
With love,
The ducci duo!",-1
"Ordered online through Yelp and got roast beef hoagie with extra Swiss cheese. I got the sandwich and it had American on it and only a few slices. So I call them up and describe the mix up. The guy on the phone says ""we don't have Swiss"" (despite it being an option on the online order form). And when I asked why he didn't call to let me know, he said ""oh someone probably tried to call you."" I had no missed calls on my phone, so that obviously was a lie. Then I asked about the extra cheese that I ordered and he said all sandwiches get two slices of cheese, and extra cheese means you get three slices.  I told him that our definition of extra cheese is very different. I'd like to say I'll never order from here again, but they have good food just shitty customer service.",-1
My girlfriend and I went there for an early lunch on a Sunday morning shortly after they opened up. I instantly noticed the dirty floor and the sticky table. Once we sat down. Then we were given the menus that actually had food pieces on them. I didn't want to gross out my girlfriend so I didn't say anything. Food and service and price were all very good. It's a shame they didn't clean the place otherwise I would have been happy to give them a five-star. I assume that Saturday night was busy and they just didn't clean up.,-1
"You can always tell when the manager is not working because the service levels decrease and the wait time increases. I seriously waited 28 minutes to get a Pick Dos meal and the staff still forgot to Make It Wet with queso. And no, it was not a busy night. Only 2 tables dining in and no one was in line prior to us. Let's step it up TJ Flats.",-1
"But, It might be a 2 stars.  All of the staff were great, but the 2 room suite with a small version of a kitchen was more like a 2.  Poorly done ""remodel"" or just plain in need of remodeling.  Bummer",-1
"Let me start by saying I have had many great experiences at Jones but I forgot what it's like to book a reservation for a star group restaurant.
I tried to make a Sunday brunch reservation before the flower show for 10 people and was told I needed to speak with some one in the events office( not sure when a party of ten became an event).
I was told to book this i would need a preset menu and a deposit. Who does this? I spent over 25 years working in restaurants doing every job from busboy up to managing partner and I have never heard of doing this. I guess the Star group doesn't need the sales",-1
"Great location and outdoor seating is fantastic. Food is not remarkable and service the night we were there was less than impressive. Apps came out before cocktails, entree was poorly described (and tasted even worse). Highlights- Grit Souffle and view. Too many good places in town to spend my dollars and calories.",-1
"What is the big deal with this place, anyway? People line up around the block, and for what? Hype, as far as I can tell. There was absolutely not a damn thing special about my breakfast. Maybe a step up from IHOP, but not deserving of a long wait by any standard. Large portions, sure; but you can get that most anywhere in the South for breakfast. I have nothing special to tell you about my meal, or my friends' meals which I tasted. Just standard breakfast fare. And my breakfast potatoes are WAY better! I don't know, I would skip this place unless you're starving and there happens to not be a line that day. I'd rather eat at Noshville even.",1
Usually decent place to shop but the employee was so rude today for no reason. Totally unacceptable considering how much I spend there.,-1
"The service was nice at check out but some of the employees barrel through the store with out anything close to an ""Excuse me."" So over all, I give the customer service a 3. The items that they had were generally of decent quality. However, the prices aren't really that great. There was a faux leather jacket with a gaping hole in the arm and they still had it priced at 15.00. Some of the toys were obviously dollar tree buys were priced at 2.99. Yes, you can buy a real polo here for around 7.99, about half the price you'd pay the mall, However, I can go down the street to the salvation army and buy a real kids polo for 1.99. If you have a list of clothing that you need this place would be great as t hey have a huge selection and you'll probably find what you're looking for, but if your just browsing for a deal try the regular thrift stores or yard sales. They are hit and miss but the prices are better. Overall I give the prices a 2. The store was pretty clean an organized and I'll give that a 4.",1
We used to come here all the time but we notice the quality of food is not the same and the prices go up we had the chicken Parmesan it was so rubbery and the pasta was hard like it wasn't boiled long enough they also got rid of the nachos which were my fav the movie screen is brightness is also very low sometimes I can't make out what's going on hopefully they can fix these simple issues on the plus side the chairs are very comfortable,-1
"Food is good, manager is great, kitchen timing needs work.

3 of 5 dishes (2 lasagna, 2 ravioli and 1 chick fettuccine) came out then we waited 4 minutes for another lasagna and the capalini and meatball. The kitchen is that small they can't time the dishes to come out. Sure it's Italian, ""mangia mangia"", so you don't need to wait for others but the we usually do so food gets cold.

That said, the food was very good. I love to try the variety of lasagna in Santa Barbara. The largest portion, but not the best is from Arnoldi's Cafe, Trattoria Vittoria when it's done with lamb, is my favorite but a big round of applause for Tre Lune. The bechamel sauce was great and as mentioned, I'm a sucker for lamb ragu. This is the dish to beat.

While I'm disappointed at the delivery (minus one star), the food was very good (4 star). I'll ding them today but certainly return for more lasagna. You've won my heart over Trattoria, and that's hard to do.",1
"The quality of furniture here is absolutely horrible.  I bought a couch, loveseat, and recliner and paid a lot for them they were what they call bonded leather after only a couple of years all the surface had peeled off of all three pieces.  I also bought their joke of a warranty that considers this normal wear.  What a joke! Ashley Furniture is a rip off!",-1
"I love 312 deep dish pizza. So much so, that the restaurant was on the short list of places I wanted to go during my last week in Nashville. I called last night to see how long the wait was, and was told that there was no wait. So my friends and I drove all the way across town for dinner at 8 pm. As soon as we asked for a table, we were told that they were out of deep dish. What?! How does a restaurant run out of their signature menu item?! And how did the person who answered the phone fail to tell me that when I called to ask about the wait? I would have appreciated the warning and would probably have delayed my 312 dinner for one more day. 

We love the deep dish pizza so much that we decided to stay and try the thin crust. It wasn't until after we ordered, though, that our waitress told us it would be an hour wait! We know that's the deal for the deep dish, but it was doubly disappointing to get to the restaurant, find out they don't have deep dish, and then have to wait an hour for the thin crust (which was okay, but would never have made it on my short list to hit before leaving town).

All in all, it was a disappointing night for what has been one of my favorite Nashville spots. Big bummer.

TL; DR:  call before you go and ask whether the restaurant is still serving deep dish because apparently 312 sometimes runs out of the crust.",-1
"My Husband and I have been to Applebees quite a bit.
It is less than a mile from us, Monday nights, 
Delicious burgers for under $3.00.   
    We have never been ignored, we have never had a Rude water / waitress.  We have been there on very busy nights. 
Sometimes when someone is regarded as rude, 
When actually......
1.). They are running their legs off 
2.). They are short handed 
3.). Boss in a bad mood
4.). That person is trying to please everyone 
Since we are not the only people asking for things. 
5.). They remember who tips well
And who needs to tip much better.

These people make less than three dollars an hour.  
If they do not make the minimum wage, they have to make it 
Up, or they will lose their job.   
     Give them a Break.  If it were not for Waiters/ waitresses Bartenders, you would have no where to go.You would have to fix it yourself.  
       Try to be more understanding. We tip 25% - 30%",1
"We took a trip to New Orleans for spring break/my son's 11th birthday.  One of our excursions was the Swamp Tour, our guide was Capt. Troy.    Please please please take this tour.  When I say it was awesome, that is an understatement.  Capt. Troy provided us with a wealth of information.  He was very patient and answered every question that was asked.  I am  a Swamp People (the reality show) fan and I learned stuff that was totally different than the show....oh AND we were on Honey Island, how cool is that. 

If you take a trip to the Bayou make sure you book a swamp tour through Cajun Encounters, you will NOT be disappointed from beginning to end.",1
"You don't accept cash?  I don't think you grasp the ramifications of such a corpo-fascist economic principle.  No room for arrogant commies in my diet thank you so very very little.  Can't wait to see this place nosedive

"Completely unprofessional and pathetic. I called last week to get price quotes on a battery and brakes. I spoke to someone very nice- he gave me two quotes, fairly low but close to other shops. I call today to schedule a time to come in and the prick who answers the phone, his name is either Mike or Nick (and quite frankly I don't care what he's called), tells me there is no battery even close to that price. He ""blames"" the quote on me, saying ""I don't know how you came up with that price?"" Then I told him I'd like to speak to someone else and he says ""no, we won't do a battery for that price, so bye-bye"" and he HUNG up the phone. NEVER NEVER call these people. I can go to Walmart before I deal with these assholes.",-1
"Well let's start with the good. Panera type restaurant with good food and laid back atmosphere. Now with the bad a focus on the staff. Every time I go up there the staff seems to really hate being there or has an attitude you'd prefer not to see when walking in a place. It actually makes me not want to go up there for food anymore. Definetly not world class customer service on any scale and the sad thing is, they barely have to interact with you.",-1
My hairdresser was very thorough in getting details of what I wanted. Then she checked frequently during the haircut to make sure I liked it.  I did!,1
"Pathetic experience with them. I ordered for rava masala dosa and vegetable uttapam to take out. They gave me dosa which is as good as burnt. Packing was so bad that the dosa layer has stuck to the white sheet of wrap. It did not smell good either. I called them and explained the story. I was expecting an apology and someone to provide us with the replacement if not refund but nothing of the sort. They did not even apologize, forget about refund or replacement. i shall be disposing the dosa as is.
Uttapam was not very good either. It tasted sour and cilantro seemed old. I could not take it more than few loaves. Remaining will go in the dustbin as well. 
Such a disgusting experience with them",-1
"I luv coming here. If I am on my lunch hour , they are very good about getting the food and my check out so I am not late .
I had the Banzai Burger. Done the right way and it was yummy. I also like the loyalty program. Every time I come I try a new item and I have not been disappointed yet !
Staff is friendly",1
"Dmitri's is the best Greek food in town. If you're a seafood lover, go for the shrimp pil pil and the octopus. The grilled lamb and chicken entrees are the only non seafood items, but they're fantastic. Make sure to get the hummus - it comes with unlimited warm grilled pita and baguette.

Also - BYOB! And they don't take reservations. Kitchen closes at 10 so make sure to get there by 9:30.",1
"Not impressed. My husband and I decided to try take out this evening from this place. When we got home we opened our daughters spaghetti and meatballs and there was hardly any pasta/sauce and NO meatballs. Frustrating. Hubby had to drive back to the restaurant to get her meal corrected. I'll also add that I think $9 for a kids meals is a bit absurd for PASTA. My fettuccini Alfredo was bland. The portion was small but I never finish all the pasta most places give me so that wasn't a big deal. My husbands tortellini tasted like it was frozen, same with the calamari. Definitely doesn't taste like they use fresh ingredients. I will say they marinara is good but not enough for us to go back. A disappointing experience.",-1
"Went here for the great food I had experienced before. 
After HORRIBLE service, flagging down the waitresses, & being told they were out of all drinks except alcohol & water, my friends and I left leaving cash at the table to cover our tabs but did not tip. The staff proceeded to call my boyfriend a nigger & follow my friend outside threatening to call the cops.  I was disappointed in the wait staff but their intolerance & bigotry will definitely prevent me from ever going back.",-1
"I would really like to try this place but every time I show up they are unexpectedly closed! The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don't have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won't be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same.",-1
"So helpful & they had everything we needed for an event. Being from out of town, I had to make my choices by phone and online. They helped make everything super-easy. Once I got there, they had everything ready for me & helped me try everything on. 
The costumes were so cute & authentic and were a big hit at the event. Remember Me was just what we needed!",1
"Update on 03/02/2012 
This was previously a review that provided a less than desirable rating for the Peppermill.  I am writing this as an amendment to the previous review (below) and changing its one star rating, as I was contacted by a very nice gentleman in management (Dave).  Through him, the Peppermill has taken a very large step in an effort to change my opinion of itself as ""the premier resort"" in Reno. Dave has helped to restore my faith in the resort, its management and the people there. We will update again after the next stay",1
"I've been back to Megu three times over the past two months, and I was finally prompted to write an update, as on each visit I wasn't as satisfied as I have been in the past. I'm really hoping I managed to visit on off days, because if the incredibly mediocre service and the overall average sushi is more than a trend, I will be devastated. I know a new year should bring about change, but it's heartbreaking that the change at my favorite local sushi joint has been negative.",-1

"I wanted somewhere new for Cinco de Mayo and had never been here. 

Overall, it was okay. I liked how you could customize the guacamole-adding crab, tomatoes, garlic, etc but I thought the guac was a little bland still. The chicken tacos were good but nothing special. The margaritas were also just okay-maybe I'm used to flavored ones.

Would I come back here? Yes. Would it be my first choice for Mexican? No.",1
"Beautiful shop; hands down one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's very modern and chic in a way. Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! 

We couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)

To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fiancée's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.

Iffy on whether or not we'll be back. I want to like this place, but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking.",-1
"When I think about the time I spent waiting for the server to arrive, for a drinkable cup of coffee to replace the one that tasted like it has been brewed with a goat's hoof, and to digest the hard lump of cheese and egg that was my breakfast, I really wish I had chosen instead to stand in the line-up at Sugarbowl.",-1
"I have been going to Mimosa for waxing for a few years now. I have always had a good experience and left a happy customer!

I was in over the weekend for a wax and realized the next day that there was still some hair left behind, so I left a voicemail with the issue on a day they were closed. 
I was pleased when they contacted me bright and early the next business day, and promptly got me in for a touch-up wax, free of charge.

Very pleased with how they handled the situation, I will continue going there for years to come!",1
This place has similar concept as Chipotle but you only get 3 add ons after that you have to pay extra for even lettuce and onions. I would say it's just a glorified overpriced Chipotle.,-1
"Completely UNDERWHELMED........ Love John Besh, but he wasn't fooling me--that was étouffée sauce on the shrimp and grits!  If I wanted étouffée, I would have order it. Food was okay, but VERY expensive.",-1
i've been to dickey's in at least three locations in other cities. usually its great and i enjoy the meats and the sides.  great weekly specials.  i was totally disappointed with this trip in new orleans.  the manager was training the new staff on how to cut meat and serve it up. terrible job.  everybody knows you cut brisket  against the grain and thin. mine was awful and i didn't know until i got back to the hotel.  i have not gone back. great sauces and sides. free ice cream and great desserts. too bad about the brisket. i love the ribs so i may try it again.,-1
"I usually don't write reviews of chains unless they are really great or really awful. This Cracker Barrel verged on the latter.  I had gone there lusting after a chicken fried steak and this is what I got.  It wasn't bad nor were the scrambled eggs. What did disappoint me were the grits and the gravy. The grits were gummy and the gravy was kind of like paste with a hint of chlorine. Things that should be easy to make but just not good. The biscuit wasn't   bad but even it was a tad strange being more crispy than I would expect.

Everything else was as good as you can expect in a chain but after this experience I think I'll keep on looking.",-1
"We came for my bachelorette party. A little bit pricey for Reno. We got 2 VIP tables which were fine - didn't have to wait in line which was nice. Service was pretty good. It's a nice looking club but the pool is a waste of space - there were 2 bay watch looking girls dancing in the pool - kind of weird. Bottle service was ok but a bit sneaky - they kept putting GSR bottled water on the table (the same ones you get free in the room - actually smaller) so we kept drinking them. Found out later that the bottled water wasn't included in our package and we were charged ridiculous prices for each one. If we had known, we would have just drank the carafe water. We had a good time (15 girls on a bachelorette party - kind of hard not to) but that kind of left a bad taste in our mouth. Also, I cut my toe while in the club and not one staff or security member could offer me any first aid assistance other than a dirty rag. I ended up hobbling out of the club and into a casino bathroom where a housekeeper found me a bandaid. I go to Reno and GSR often but probably won't visit LEX again.",-1
"Zimmer's Seafood, located at an underdeveloped pedestrian friendly intersection in the heart of Voscoville, prepares arguably the best dressed shrimp po-boy in town (Castnet's are very good as well). You pay for quality here as Zimmer's is not the cheapest but we want real shrimp not the dried bite sized variety right? Of course. My only gripe is that they are closed on Sundays in opposition to my stomach's occasional Sunday po-boy craving. Check it out!",1
I enjoy Chick-fil-a's spicy chicken sandwich and waffle fries. The quality of the food at this location is no different relative to other stores in the chain although it may have a smaller menu. During lunch hours the long can get very long and it feels like they rush you away at the counter without much time to even put your money or credit card away. On the bright side because they are so busy the wait isn't too long after you order. Its better to get this to go and eat in your car unless you have a table already since seating can be hard to come by.,1
"Wonderful service! They took me last minute for a pedicure, 10 minutes before closing, and didn't rush through the job! They had hot stones, paraffin for your heels, and I got a great massage when my toes were drying! 4 stars because the price was a bit high, but great customer service and my pedicure is still going strong, 3 weeks later.",1
"I have never stayed at a hotel so ghetto. Sure the atmosphere is great and very classy looking. However the staff is the opposite. First of all, my friend booked us a suite for the bachelorette party she was planning. They gave us two separate rooms and my friend had to beg for them to be at least next door to each other since they ran out of suites. Then to make up for it, they threw in free valet. The next day her car had been keyed on her door when the valet brought it from the parking garage. Seriously? Worst experience and I certainly won't ever be back.",-1
"Of course we are from out of town. Drove by it alot so we stopped and tryed it, the food was great the atmosphere was great.. We had the rudest waitress i have ever encounter she did not say hi she never smiled it was like we were bothering her to be there.... i wish we would of had another waitress we probably would have stayed longer, i suggested to the people i was with after we paid our tab to her to go to the bar and they said no lets just get outta here...its amazing how one person can make you feel this way..",-1
We tested this place out all due to the Santa Barbara Axxess card membership.  We all decided on the brew sampler tray and it didn't disappoint! We'll return aging for sure.,1
"When Waitress came to take drink order, I commented that I like  light beer, she immediately responded with ""we don't have light beer"". I asked her what she would recommend on tap since ""I like light beer"". She came across as very rude. Later, when I placed my food order, I asked if they had sour cream, and again, I got a very rude response. The food is actually pretty good, despite the service. The place is very cozy and a nice atmosphere. I would probably come back just hopefully won't get the same waitress. If you are with a large group, just a heads up, they won't split the bill and they will only take up to 5 credit cards to pay the bill.  Very inconvenient especially since it's 2016! Really, you can't separate the bills?",-1
I needed a diagnostic screening.  I was in and out quickly because I had a reservation but there were a bunch of mad customers in the waiting area and only 2 employees.  They were overworked.  They at least need a receptionist and another back of the house employee.  I gathered that walk-in customers were waiting LONG.,-1
"Came here on a whim a few years ago.  Was hoping it was as good as I remembered.

I called on both days I took my car in to get tinted. The first time I was told to bring it in at 4pm but when I arrived I was told by the owner that he needed a minimum of 3 hours since they needed to remove the old tint and re-tint. I called them again two days later and asked if I could make a appointment. I explained everything that I discussed with the owner to the person on the other end and was told to bring in the car and they would be able to complete it within 4 hours along with a quote.  Once I arrived to the shop I was told the my car would need to be there the entire day and the amount I was quoted pretty much doubled. When I explained the issue to the owner he pretty much blamed me since I didn't make a appointment even when I told him that was the point of the phone call the morning of. I'm not sure if the employees don't communicate properly but they definitely need better communication and customer service skills.,-1
"One star for location, another for our great waiter, Milton.  No stars for the food.

Our group of 4 decided to grab a bite here around 9pm on a recent weeknight.  Oyster po-boy was bland, over-mayo'd, and served on bread that could've come from the grocery.  Oyster/shrimp po-boy was the same.  The lonely 4 shrimp in the shrimp creole were mealy.  

Sadly, given the location, the drinks couldn't save the place, either.  Mint julep was nearly clear and the Big Easy Lemonade, a house drink, more closely approximated CountryTime with a spritz of grandma's everclear than the menu description.

As we left, we suggested that the folks waiting in line outside check out the po-boy cart behind them.

Milton, however, was warm and accommodating.  Well-played, sir.",-1
"Well my boyfriend and I gave Cheddars a second chance recently, because the time before we had awful service. The food has always been pretty good and that's why we choose to go back. We had great service this time and the drinks and food were great!! The only complaint I would have is that we ordered an appetizer and barely had the chance to eat any of it before our dinner came out. We were still charged for the appetizer. All and all its reasonable and family friendly place to go!",1
"I visited Jake's for the first time after learning that the small diner I used to go to in Delaware as a kid had become a franchise. I was so excited to experience the delicious burgers and fries that I craved as a kid.

I walked into the establishment and was frankly unimpressed by the ambiance. The restaurant was moderately clean and very open. The menu actually reminded my of a Five Guys. You get to choose your own toppings (all free) to put on 1, 2, or 3 patties.

I ordered the regular cheeseburger with a ton of toppings and a regular size french fry to share with my boyfriend. The burgers were delicious. The bread was soft and tasty and the burgers were succulent and juicy. The fries were disappointing. McDonalds fries taste better and usually aren't even as cold as Jake's were.

Man oh man, Jake's. I'll go back for the burgers, maybe, but I definitely will stick to the original location for a better experience.",1
"We, the two of us, went there March 4th for a late lunch.  The place was completely crowded with people waiting outside for a table.  We are vegans and my wife is gluten intolerant.  There was only one item on the menu that we thought we could eat, a vegetarian ramen bowl.  We asked the waiter if we could get gluten free noodles and he said yes so we ordered two of the same for ourselves.  When the bowls arrived a different server said they were not gluten free as the broth was very cloudy.  The person who took our order neglected to tell us the broth was made with wheat and there was nothing else on the menu she could eat, everything had meat or wheat in it.  My wife rejected the order and I ate mine.  Wife had nothing to eat and had to sit there watching me eat mine. 
 
I find it amazing that in a restaurant that advertises itself as selling Japanese food doesn't have any Japanese dishes without meat or wheat.  Japan is or was a rice based food culture with many dishes without meat or fish.  All I can figure is Raijin thinks all Americans want meat and wheat so they design their menu accordingly.

Yoshimatsu restaurant on Campbell Ave. sells many meat and wheat free dishes.  

Raijin is also overpriced for what you get.  Yoshimatsu is cheaper with a lot more variety in the dishes especially ramen dishes.

We ate a a ramen restaurant in downtown San Diego recently that served vegan and gluten free ramen bowls.

I hope Raijin reads this and changes their menu because my ramen bowl was very good with the added garlic hot mixture I ordered as a side and put into my bowl. I would like to return there and give it another try with my wife.

There are many, many people out there that don't eat meat and or wheat after all.",-1
Friendly gracious and efficient what more could you ask for?? I have dogs and they sure got the car clean!,1
"We just happened to drive by and saw this place so we decided to stop for lunch. Once we sat down I realized this is not a place for families because it was filled with men. I soon realized the over population of male customers was because of the attractive, all female servers. The menu looked good and they had a kids menu so we decided to stay. We ordered the pretzels sticks, chicken bites, yard bird sandwich and lamb burger. Everything tasted ok nothing exceptional. The worst part was the two men sitting next to us who were drunk (literally doing shots) at 1:00pm on a Tuesday. They were older/middle aged, every other word was a swear and they were obnoxious to the servers. That's the sort of clientele this place attracts. The best part was our server though, she was very efficient and nice. 

Lastly, the bathrooms were disgusting! Mold all over the sink like it has not had a thorough leaning in a loooooong time.",1
"I've been here a few times since I moved here at the end of last year... This place is ok, but nothing to get excited about.  Their strawberry lemonade is very good :)  I usually get the porkies and they are ok... The service here has never been 'knock me down good'.  Our waitress today (Easter Sunday) wasn't friendly, but she wasn't rude.  She was just there, didn't over exert herself.. I've heard they do have some good drink specials occasionally, but I haven't taken advantage of them.",1
I really liked this place when it opened but the quality has continued to decline.  Sad because the concept is a good one.  this was my last trip there . I can no longer accept salt free lunches or paying for ingredients that never make it into the salad.,-1
Ahhh it is ok but nowhere near the ambiance of Cafe du Monde.  I've never seen this place crowded so you do get super fast service.  I really don't care for beignets but they have those here too and it is all very similar to Cafe du Monde EXCEPT they also have a decent small menu of some New Orleans classic dishes so I would say the dining options here are far superior to Cafe du Monde (but a terrible location in a strip mall).,1
"The Dallas Bull never disappoints! Having been a regular on Thursday nights, we decided to give Saturday a try. The crowd was light in the early hours but it sure got crowded around 11pm. Bar service was decent and I didn't have to wait too long to get a drink. My only complaint is that the new DJ doesn't count in the songs which leads to chaos on the dance floor as many people don't know when to start the line dance correctly. This lead to me getting stepped on quite a few times (which is not fun when people are wearing cowboy boots and think they know how to line dance). Hopefully they will get the DJ to start counting in the songs!",-1
"The only reason that I give it 4 stars is because I'm rarely actually craving Chinese food...  After 4 years of bad take-out Chinese in college, my stomach churns at the thought most days...

But Chinese delight is different.  We've gotten delivery as well as eat-in.  I can't really make any comment about price or delivery time, as the bf usually pays and the group is too busy hanging out and gaming to notice the time.  But the food always satisfies.  The spring rolls are delicious.  The lo mein is my favorite.  The spicey food is spicey, and the non-spicey food is still delicious.

When we ate in the restaurant it was a pleasant experience.  Instead of bread or chips like other restaurants give you, here they give you a bowl of won-ton noodles (those tasty chip things) and two of us wiped out two bowls flat before our food came.  OMG I could eat my weight in those noodles if left to my own devices....

Sure, there's always a language barrier at Chinese restaurants, but I found the people to be friendly, regardless.  I noticed the owner went over to one of the other tables and started passing around a picture of her grandson or something.  Pretty funny, if you ask me.  My bf and his friends have been regulars there for years so the people at the restaurant know them by name and face.  When we all ate there once it was like a big family reunion, everyone was joking with each other - but mostly because we were the only people in there.  When it was just me and the bf there was only one other table, but the phones were ringing off the hook (it was Sunday afternoon) and there was a steady, unrelenting flow of people for take-out.  The food came out fast, too, so I suspect that if you order for pick up it'll get there much faster than delivery, since the poor guy has probably like 5 stops each delivery!

Now that we're cooking our own food most of the time, when we do decide to order from Chinese Delight I'm always in for it.  For a take-out-and-delivery Chinese food place, it's top notch.  No, seriously.  If you want a fancy, romantic expensive Chinese restaurant, go to Margaret Kuo's.  But if you want some good Chinese take-out that will renew your love for easy Asian food (you know, the love that was crushed by the greasy, gross, nasty cheap Chinese food that you remember from all-nighters in college?), then give Chinese Delight a try.  If you like Chinese food AT ALL, you'll like this place.

.....damn, now I want some lo mein.... and a spring roll....  and wonton crackers..",1
"I am so done with this franchise. 

 We had been ordering from them almost weekly since they opened and at first, their pizza was outstanding.  Plenty of toppings, spicy sauce, and a light crunchy crust.  Gradually, however, they declined in quality and quantity.  We quit ordering for many months.

Last weekend, we gave it another try, but it has gotten worse.  Very skimpy toppings and the crust was slightly underdone.  The pizzas in the box looked nothing like the pics on the box.  I'd say our pizzas were equivalent to a $5 hot-n-ready from Little Caesar's, but we paid ~$15 each.

So very, very dissappointed.",-1
"Fried rice looks like brown rice about 2 1/4 in chunks of egg. No vegtibles to be recognized . Like they had a water gun of soy sauce and was randomly shooting the rice,  while they were drying it out.. I gave it 2 stars, because I am generous like that.",-1
Very nice delivery driver. But very slow service. Sandwich was less than satisfactory. They still owe me a $17 refund from a month ago. There were no napkins with my order. I am just teally disappointed.,-1
I'm a sucker for good Italian.  I hit this place on a Monday and staff was clearly looking to closed down.  Ordered risotto (the special) and got a ton of it but was way too much and super hot like it was just microwaved.  Atmosphere is old school which is nice and complimentary valet is nice touch.,1
"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We went during Sunday happy hour and I specifically asked our waitress about specials and she told me brunch was over and there were no other specials. Come to find out there was a whole happy hour menu and 2 of the beers we ordered were on happy hour but we were charged full price. The waitress was not apologetic, just annoyed when I confronted her and said ""I didn't know you wanted happy hour"". I was confused because it is the first thing I asked her whenever she finally decided to greet our table.  She also rarely came to our table to check on us. Go elsewhere, there are plenty of better places in the area to eat and drink.",-1
"Not a bad experience.  I am a more savvy car buyer and always negotiate over the phone. I managed to negotiate the price down $4000 less than the MSRP after calling a few times.  Originally, they did not want to lower it buy that much but they kept at it to make the sale and called me after two hours to beat the price I had given them from another dealer.",1
"Decent hotel for a one night stay in the theatre district. Convenient location. Everything's in walking distance. Didn't have to pay the $28 overnight parking fee as a hotel guest. Room was comfortable. Staff was friendly. They even gave us cookies at check in. 

Only con is the noise level outside which is to be expected in the city.",1
"I can't believe what I paid for a room that had a spa, two televisions, king size bed, a dining area and a living room area for such a low price. I booked online to get the best rate, but it was super cheap. I look forward to coming back again real soon!",1
Decent falafel wrap...but not exactly cheap. And the cave-like sitting area was cold and uninviting. There are better choices in Manayunk.,-1
"Brought my dog for treatment, I have to say it's the most unprofessional business I have ever been to. Extremely rude and obnoxious group of underachievers. They need a good lesson in manners and need to understand it's not about them it's about the animals in their care. If you care about your animals don't take them to Turkey Creek Animal Hospital for there all turkeys!",-1
"We have rented from Milpas Rental for over 12 years to include major rentals for our vacation home remodel. I rented a carpet cleaner from them today as I could not get a carpeting cleaning company to come out on short notice. Upon using the carpet cleaner I run into a glitch. When returning the item I explained the situation and they were most accommodating.
Thanks again!",1
Not sure if it's right that sushi was warm when it came to the table. Service was sloooooooow.,-1
"Since this is a live act venue you cant review whether or not the show itself was funny.

I can only review the service and the price .

Service 
Get at Least 2 drinks at a time because the drinks are super slow to come

Price value
Check out YouTube of your headliners before you go.

Pre shows
This was one of the worst experiences I've had . You don't get in till right before.
There isn't anywhere to seat pre show . So you get to stand like cattle.

Wtf? Also there are no washrooms , you have to go to earls across the street.

Wow. Weak.

Come to this venue if you are looking for a low rent but possible fun time.

It's like going to a bowling alley for comedy/",-1
"I was looking for a solution to tame my frizz not wanting to go the keratin route and ended up booking the phyto relaxer treatment here thinking it's just a smoothing treatment. I know, stupid me! My appointment was booked with Drea, the master stylist here. One look at my hair and she said I don't need to go the relaxer route. I just need some deep conditioning to hydrate my hair. I'm glad she just gave me good advice without trying to upsell treatments. The entire process took almost an hour and I just walked out of the salon with smooth nicely blow dried hair. Thanks Drea for understanding my attempt of reducing chemicals and unnecessarily stressing my hair.",1
"Yum. Tater tots on pizza. Late night delivery that came faster than promised. Friendly staff taking the order, and a delivery guy who made me smile. Can't ask for much more. Thanks! We wish we lived closer...",1
Ordered the Korean tacos made from naa bread and meat was very cheap. More than half the meat was fat. Also very little meat overall. Unfortunately did not like my experience.,1
"When they highlight NICE in CoNICElli it's for a reason!  They mean it! They are all so nice!  Seriously!  
I bought my Honda CRV there and bring it there to get services.  You couldn't ask for a better group of people.  One of the servicemen actually sat in my car with me for  over 10 minutes helping to explain some phone features I had questions on.
Thank you Conicelli Honda!",1
"I created this yelp account just so I could write a review for this place. So I was on my way through Nashville while on a trip to Texas from Maine with my girlfriend and decided to stay in Nashville for the night. We stopped by this restaurant and started off with some drinks which were both fantastic beers that were recommended by our waitress. We then ordered our burgers, I ordered the chili-chili bang bang and the Benton's bacon mac and cheese and my girlfriend got the buy the farm and truffle tots. Now here's where things got interesting and the reason why this place gets a 5 instead of 4 from me...... I got my food (which was cooked perfectly and had plenty of flavor) and my girlfriend took a bite into her burger and pulled out what appeared to be plastic from it. We politely told our waitress and she took the burger right back and had them make a new one for us. The manager (I believe, it may have been the chef) comes out and apologized and you could tell he was very remorseful and that this is not a regular occurrence. He explained that the wax surrounding the cheese must not have come off and fixed the burger immediately and triple checked everything again. He even came out with two extra sides of tots and quickly brought her burger back. Then to top off this already incredibly generous gesture, they comped her entire meal for us (which they didn't have to do, for after that level of service I would've been glad to pay full price). We made sure that we still tipped over 20% of the original price of the meal before some of the food was comped for the excellent service. I went in to try and shake that gentleman's hand but he had gone out back right as I was leaving. I would recommend this place to anyone of my friends who are traveling to Nashville, and I will definitely make a repeat trip the next time I'm here",1
"This was just the adventure we were looking for! We rented a Pontoon boat to go spend the night on Anclote Sandbar. Our group was 3 adults and 2 kids. The staff was very friendly and informative of the rules to follow for safety.  We paid to have a porta-potty available on the boat since we were staying the night. If you're just going for the day I doubt you'll need it. 

Their website is REALLY informative. And you can read about other people's experiences too. What I found useful were the stories about people who didn't follow directions and had stuff happen. Understand their mistakes and you won't fall into that problem. You WILL pay for emergency services. You WILL pay for broken equipment. You would charge someone accordingly if it was your business.

We had a great time camping on the Sandbar and would do it again without question. They offer more than just pontoon boats so check out their website and start making some memories!  See my pictures, because truly, words don't do this beautiful little excursion we had justice!",1
"I am so angry with myself for having foolishly fallen for their sign-up offer. They made it seem so simple and it was tied to my American Airlines account so I was even offered bonus airline miles as a sign-up incentive. They've been charging me over 19cents kWh for well over two years now. I wasn't even aware that other companies charge between 9 - 10 cents. I'm angry at myself for not canceling much sooner.
I just got off the phone with them now to cancel and was told that it ""will take one to two billing cycles for the cancelation to officially go through"" so I will be paying a fortune for some time more. I recall it was instantaneous to START an account with them. Why the difference? 

Great. Right in the middle of the summer. Stay far away from this company, people.",-1
"Disappointing experience beginning with confusion with order and computer software. Had to place my order 3x, chicken wrap was okay but not spectacular, served with fries that were frozen  in the middle and soggy. Not what I expected for 10.00.",-1
"I wish I could give this zero stars, this gave my husband and kid a really really bad stomach ache after eating here. This used to be our favorite Chinese restaurant but not anymore. Never eat here. Also on another note the delivery really slow.",-1
"It's not a sushi bar and it's not a disco club, it's a hybrid of crap.

It's a Gimmick.  The quality of food is poor but the price is high.  The techno club music is blaring in your ear so the conversations are really screaming matches.  They keep the place so dark so you can't tell how bad the food looks.  The wait staff seem like they hate working there.  I wouldn't take a date here unless you think it's attractive to look at green skin and glowing yellow teeth from the stupid black lights, disco ball and epilepsy inducing strobes.

The lunch buffet is variation of wrapped up rice to cut corners.  The non-sushi items are oily and are sitting out for the entire time of the lunch hours.  

They're serving plastic food that should come w/ a side of glow sticks.  Maybe they should complete your 90's style Rave experience w/ some ecstasy pills... b/c that's the only way they're gonna make their food taste any better.",-1
"I have had several bad experiences with the Montgomery county SPCA. I never thought to look up reviews until now.  The woman who I believe may have been previously employed there pretty much nailed it. A few years ago I went to one of the branches trying to rescue a severely underweight Neapolitan mastiff. They told me verbatim that they wouldnt cat or dog test her and they go by the typical behavior of the breed.  They said it was a liability if one of the dogs or cats in the meet got injured.  That being said, the dog wouldn't be adopted out to a home with cats.  They also told me under no circumstances would they adopt out a pit bull mix to a home with other animals  That left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. They weren't even willing to work with me to save this dog.  This weekend we stopped into a different branch and fell in love with one of the pit bull mixes they had there.  Her kennel card said she was good with kids and dogs as she previously lived with both. She had been turned in about 48 hour prior to our visit due to the fact that her family was moving and couldn't bring her.  We Inquired about her at the reception area where they were MORE than friendly and eager to give us as much information as possible.  They had said she actually hadnt  had a behavior evaluation by a manager yet and that they expected that to happen within the next few days.  They also made a comment that since she was an am staff mix she would require an application. I found that to be a bit weird and wondered to myself if either of the 2 small dogs that tried to rip my head off would require the same. So, unable to control my excitement, I called today to see if she had her behavior test and to set up a meet with my resident dog. The woman said she had failed her evaluation and was no longer up for adoption.  She wasn't allowed to give me any additional information. We were heart broken. I feel like maybe if we were informed of her issues we could decide if it was something we were able to rehabilitate. I didn't understand why she had a kennel card with her information if she hadnt even been evaluated. Again, the staff there were more than willing to help and very pleasant. Even the woman on the phone thanked me for calling in.  I love the SPCA and all they stand for, but I feel like the Montgomery county SPCA is less tolerant of any kind of behavior issues and are more willing to euthanize for space rather than work with a dog whos issues may be minor.",-1
"Got an estimate but went with another plumber as this was the highest quote of the 3 plumbers we interviewed for the job.
Very prompt communication though.

Will re-consider for future jobs.  Seems reliable (and often you get what you pay for!)",1
"So... ima make this very short and simple just got a haircut from this place, thought I would check it out because of the great reviews of yelp.. worst haircut of my life.. it seemed like the hair stylist had no idea what she was doing. My hair is completely uneven. So bad I actually felt like crying and I am a 20 year old guy. I went to a different barber shop later that day so they could shave my head. Maybe they cut women's hair really nice but guys do not come here unless you want people laughing at your haircut.",-1
"I'm a fan because it's across the street, open on sundays and quiet. I don't think they have the swankiest setting, nor do they have the latest and the greatest, but when you want a cheap fill b/c you've managed to grow out your nails within a week and have actually broken 5 of them--close and cheap is all you need.

I went in with mismatched nails and ended up leaving with a decent fill. It's not the prettiest nails I've ever had but given what the guy who put them on did, I think she fixed them up nicely.

OH, and I hate places filled to the brim with obnoxious people and loud noises, so this place was great!",1
"3.50 stars.  

Gabby's wasn't open.  I knew that.  Neither was Rotier's.  But my handy Yelp app had assured me that Fido's was open.  Imagine the disappointment when I realized there was a very real possibility that no burgers would happen on this trip down to the Deep South.  Would I really have to wait two more weeks when I would find solace in East Texas?   

""We can try Burger up,"" I mentioned.  

""Why don't you just call them?"" hissed the appropriately nicknamed Viper.  

True.  We didn't have to keep driving around aimlessly.  So I call Burger Up, and a very pleasant, sweet voice assures me they are indeed open.  

Viper: ""What was her name?  She sounded hot.""
  
Me: ""Paige.""

Viper: ""Yeah, she's definitely hot.  Have you ever met an unattractive Paige?""

Me: ""Good point.  At least we have that going for us.""

Paige was indeed attractive, but this review isn't about a photogenic individual who happens to work at Burger Up.  It's about what ended up being a visit to our fourth choice for burgers in Nashville.  

Burger Up follows a national trend towards upscale burgers.  My particular order consisted of a medium rare patty served with aged cheddar, Benton's bacon (very good), and ketchup served on an artisan bun.  Basically, it was a gussied up bacon cheeseburger, but it was a rather tasty one.  My major complaint is that I wish the actual meat itself exhibited more flavor.  Having said that, the burger was cooked properly and the flavors worked well together.  I ordered some wilted spinach on the side (mediocre) and truffle fries.  Let's talk about those truffle fries for a bit.  I know more people are apparently into the sweet potato fries here, but I think they are missing the boat.  Burger Up's truffle tries have pleasant aroma, taste great, and are the perfect texture for soaking up oil.  If you are on a diet, it is true you should skip these delightful fries.  But if that were the case, why are you at a burger joint in the first place?  Seriously, if you get nothing else out of my review, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries.  

Burger Up also boast an interesting beer menu with semi-obscure breweries from the Deep South included in the list.  I tried a pecan-infused amber from Mississippi - not bad.  I could imagine Burger Up could be a decent place to drink for a bit after eating.  

If I attended Vanderbilt, I would probably go here on a moderately frequent basis.  If you want a change from the dive bar hamburger, Burger Up is a decent change of pace.",1
"I'm very familiar w/ all the Marathons and this is the bleakest star in their dim galaxy! 

The lighting always seems oddly low, not inviting and cozy, more like ""we're saving electricity"" and want to appear closed. Zero for atmosphere in the evenings... My last time there, after heading in and standing w/ my friend , front and center, waiting to be seated in the 1/4 filled restaurant, we waited easily 10-15 minutes for attention of any kind. The waiters mostly hung out by the bar and in the recesses of the restaurant, slouching and gabbing, w/ not a glance at us obviously waiting....finally, let's call him ""Mr.Hunky"", deigned to come up and and said ""Yo, what's up?"". I thought this was a restaurant, not a singles bar from the 70's?
""Mr.Hunky"" had passed us a couple times previously but seemed unable to multitask and  seat us at any of the plentiful open tables, too busy to rush back and hang with his posse....I was amazed and said we were waiting to be seated (duh)....but we decided to exit and eat at Jones round the corner where they welcome diners. 

I've been previously underwhelmed, overall, by the food here and at other Marathons. The  new menu seems to have carved down portions on practically everything.  The burgers are the safest bet, but you may as well not bother ordering it to taste, because it's never right. They also got rid of the one thing that was superb on their menu; the Salmon Nicoise Salad. That was my only reason for going there....that and the faint hope that ""Mr Hunky"" might suddenly realize his true calling and, possibly, only talent and do a spontaneous table dance, for the very first time truly earning his dollar bills! Sorry that I'll miss the performance, as I won't be going back..",-1
Came here whilst waiting for the megabus to DC. It is a dim quiet bar with a small crowd of regulars and travelers. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and fries for dinner. The fries were Luke warm and the buffalo chicken wrap was spicer than expected. A decent meal if you are hungry.,1
"NO WAY
I know others like this place ,I'm sorry to say it was awful.
The soup was ok, not filled up, looked like they didn't want to splurge with filling up to look decent.
 the salad looked like they opened a bag of salad  dribbled it on then grabbed some off. 
the garlic bread is full of jared garlic and oil  will make your stomach sick.
my son ordered lasagna , who knows what was in it 
and i ordered pasta w/ broccoli it tasted like it was sitting in salt water and that was only flavor. when they found out i didn't like it the owner or someone, picked up my plate and with his fingers grabbed the spaghetti  and put it in his mouth , need I say more how disgusting .
Over priced and was awful.",-1
"Once again,  the Red Habanero team has exceeded our expectations. Our meal tasted fantastic and the presentation was very appealing. We love the 96 street location and have no problmes driving all the way from Greenwood for a visit.

Thank you Red Habanero for another fantastic experience. We will actively see what we can do to help you open another location within Greenwood.",1
Great food but the service is so bad we seen our waitress once  everyone else did here job plus I was not finished eating and she gave me the check    Hate that   But good food,-1
I will drive out of my way and gladly wait in line for however long it takes to get the Black & Blue Sandwich and I hate hate hate waiting in lines. And here I'm good with it. That's how good this place is.,1
"I was fiending a burger last week to pick up and devour in the car and this was the closet joint to my location.  I ordered the house burger and sweet potato fries and it came out to about $18.  The bun was airy and light, the meaty part was cooked fine and the sweet potato fries were average.  All in all it was a solid meal but left my super Asian metabolism wanting more and overall worth of the meal felt more in the $12 range.  I liked the inside vibe of the place too as it brought a tranquility to my random anxious states.",1
"The food is good, cheap and fast.  It's texmex, not traditional street taco fare.  Wish they had a gf menu... it doesn't seem hard like it would be hard to offer the same tacos on corn tortillas.  
Park in the lot across the street, because parking is the worst part of the experience.",-1
"I just moved downtown and decided to try this place. $36 for three dresses? I was shocked. Stay away from this overpriced establishment. Not only did they want to charge a fortune but I had to listen to the attendant discuss his plans of getting drunk this weekend while writing my ticket. When I found out the price I said no thanks and walked out! I sure am glad I asked first! I drove to Donelson to $1.99 cleaners on Lebanon Pike because they are affordable, professional, and always do a good job.",-1
"I'm only giving four stars because in comparison to other locations, this one has some damn friendly and fast staff.

The food is on par with what you would expect. The only gripe I have is that I asked for extra pickles and they only gave me one extra one. ",1
"I have now been here 2 times, and both have been strictly out of necessity. The prices accurately reflect the overstaffed, up to date facility, while their service does not. 

While every time that you have to take your car in anywhere, you cringe at what they are going to come and tell you, this place has been far and away the worst I've experienced. I do not trust them in the slightest. If you're looking for tires, they may be ok, but the mechanic services are horrendous.",-1
"Superior grill has by far the best Mexican food I've ever tasted!  Being in the military, I've lived in 6 different states, including California. No where even comes close to the quality of ingredients that superior uses in their food.  Steak quesadilla is off the charts!",1
"I went there for a pedicure and gel manicure.  It was my first time and the reviews was what enticed me. I loved loved Young, who did my pedicure.  She was very friendly and has a very positive attitude.  She took her time with my pedicure and was very thorough with the massaging (which was the best part). 

Unfortunately Young didn't do my manicure.   I had a gel manicure that needed to be soaked off.  The owner did my nails.  She first scraped my nails with the cuticle pusher, but when it wasn't coming off fast enough, she used the drill.  I was really worried as I didn't want my nails to be thin.  But I just let her do her thing.  I'm usually not picky so when she was working on my nails I didn't watch what she was doing until I realized after close examination she didn't fully take the old gel polish off.  
Not only that, the polish didn't go on smoothly, there's are noticeable bumps on my nail bed and the sides of my nails weren't even fully covered.  

I am so disappointed.  I love Young, but I don't know if I'll be going back due to my experience with my gel manicure.",-1
"My SO, friend and I tried this place around 5:45pm Saturday night. Upon entering, the hostess asked if we had a reservation, which we did not but the front room looked pretty vacant so we figured it'd be no problem. They proceeded to take us to the furthest back area of the restaurant where the cooks are (you can see them because they work in a window enclosed space) and seated us right by the windows to their kitchen area. 

Our servers were prompt and friendly, it was still happy hour so we ordered a door#three, a rye drink and a beer. We were brought waters pretty quickly, my SO's had something in his and they quickly replaced his water upon informing the waiter. The happy hour prices are reasonable, half off the normal price which for cocktails was $11 but not sure how much the beer was. For appetizers I ordered the Bibb lettuce salad, my SO ordered the gumbo, and they bring bread and butter out immediately. Everything was good out of the appetizers and bread, we ate every bit of it 

For the entree I ordered the chicken dish with rosemary potatoes and my SO had the fried oysters, my friend had the shrimp and grits. Everything was very delicious and cooked perfectly. 

During our meal we noticed that one of the chefs put his finger in his mouth and then proceeded to handle foods with his bare hands. We thought we should probably tell someone, so we asked our waiter for the manager and a male manager came over. We informed him of what we had seen and he said okay, not seeming too concerned. He promptly walked off to go tell someone in the kitchen, ""that table over there says he put his finger in his mouth, I don't know how accurate that is but that's what they said."" Mind you, we are witnessing all of this due to the glass, and the manager is facing us and the kitchen when he says this. I went up to said manager and inform him we just saw everything he said and that's incredibly disrespectful. We had no reason to lie about it, as we already had our meals and had eaten. I was simply concerned for whose dish that was being handled. Our waiter quickly apologizes profusely and I point out that he did nothing wrong and it's not he who should be apologizing, but the manager - to which the manager stands there and says nothing. Our waiter went to go get DeDe the head manager and she came over, addressed our concerns with poise and was extremely kind. We would come back again because of how well she handled the situation.",1
"I had a delicious breakfast at Tuttini a few months ago.  I went back for lunch recently and was excited by their sandwich offerings, however, I was not served.  It was 1:45 PM, and their sign states that they serve lunch until 2:30 PM.  I waited in line for 7 or 8 minutes before a woman came out to tell me that the kitchen was closing.  Closing over 30 minutes early!  She said she might be able to make something to go.  So, if you can make something to go, doesn't that mean the kitchen is not yet closed?  Besides, I wanted to have a few minutes to relax in the cozy restaurant and enjoy my sandwich, not gulf it down on the street, so I left.  I got a sandwich at North Star Coffee around the corner and gave them my $10 instead.",-1
"I ran over a nail near some of the new construction near Allisonville Road and got a tow to this Firestone location. I had gone to another firestone location in the past, and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to pull up all of my history as I wasn't sure when the last time I got tires and also if I had purchased any warranties on it. The woman at the front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I assumed that they would make me get all 4 tires changed (as that is typically what happens when one tire goes out at least for me) but the woman walked me through why I only need to change two of my four tires. I was very grateful because that would have added another $400 if I got all four tires changed. Bottom line, I felt very confident that the employees here were looking out for my best interests, and not for their wallets!",1
So authentic so fresh and so dang tasty! I order chicken taco and steak taco with chips and salsa. Glad I ordered water because the salsa is on the spicy side,1
"I used to love Pizza Mizza. Something happened the past couple of years. The pizza is a a little thinner, a few less toppings and things like the kids eat for a dollar special is not really a full kids meal nor is is $1.00 ($1.79) I keep going because the service is always great, the location is good, and the half price pizza deal used to be good. Not sure if they are trying to save pennies or there was a change in management.",1
"Food is great, drinks are great, deals are great (Brunch with 2-4-1 drinks? Heck yeah!). The menu is extensive and interesting, with unique twists on classic dishes. The service is also great, but I am withholding a fifth star due to the management's seating policies.

We came for brunch on a Sunday expecting an hour plus wait, so when the hostess informed us it would be 1hr45m we weren't surprised. However, we became frustrated when we noticed there were 4 open tables on the patio that still hadn't been seated after an hour of waiting. It was a beautiful day so we asked the hostess about it and she said that the tables were reserved. When we asked again, she explained that the patio tables were not assigned to a specific server but were instead added on to a server's load inside, so they weren't seating them because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers. Totally understandable to not want to overwork your servers, but why not seat people with the caveat that service will be slower? Or better yet, why not specifically assign a server to the outdoor section so that wait times will be lower? Having worked in the service industry, our group was confused by this. We ended up just sitting at one of the empty patio tables until the hostess notified us that a table was ready. 

We ordered the Cheddar Biscuit, the Wood Fire Double Yokes, and a Turkey Feta Omelette from the specials board and all were delicious. The biscuit comes in a trio and though it doesn't look like a lot of food they are VERY filling. Our server surprised us with a side of White Trash Hash on the house because our food was taking longer than expected (we didn't even notice the timing, so it was a very nice gesture). The White Trash Hash is a must, this stuff is addicting! Potatoes, rice, and gooey cheese- who could ask for more.

Overall, great place for brunch in Nashville. Expect a long line but food worth the wait. Hopefully management can improve their seating policies to cut down on wait times in the future.",1
"Very disappointed.  Decor was okay. Cathedral ceilings and open floor plan.  Seemed like an appropriate venue for a wedding reception.   Menu had way to many choices. Two pages for just starters. Hard to make up your mind. ""Less is more"".  Service was okay. I ordered a seafood salad as my entree, my friend ahi tuna (seared) and my other friend a chicken sandwich.  We also ordered 3 starters for the table. Spicy shrimp dish (can't remember the name), tuna ceviche and edamame.  Its is really hard to mess up edamame, so that was okay. We did not finish the ceviche, it had no taste at all. The shrimp starter was the high light of the meal. Very good!  My seafood salad was really sad.  I felt like a rabbit eating dry vegetables. I told my server that I wanted to change my dressing to just plain lemon and olive oil. The salad came out with no dressing at all. My friends ahi tuna was pretty bad. Just did not taste fresh and the sauce for dipping was bland. My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich. I have two things to say. 1-they seemed to have put more attention into the way the food looked on the plate then the flavor of the food.  The plating was above average.  2- if you go, try to stick to basic dishes that are hard to mess up,  for example there seared ahi tuna dish was a disaster, but there grilled chicken sandwich was good.  Anything on the menu over $15 stay away from.   I most likely will not return unless I hear that they have consolidated there menu and changed the flavor profile to most of there dishes.  Btw my friends got 2 ice coffee lattes and they where $5 each. That seemed a little pricy, I could be wrong.",-1
"We walked into this bar last night - December 12th,  after we were refused service at another bar because of our group size.

The bartender, who's name I didn't get, didn't blink an eye.  He made cocktails - and put on show - right down to the mocktail we ordered. 

We were out looking for an amazing cocktail experience and he delivered.",1
"Nice stay hotel nicely decorated room OK nice comfortable bed after being out and about, paid $25 to park stated in/out but just used trolley to get around. Located about 4 blocks from Harrah's Casino and Bourbon Street. Breakfast was nice eggs oatmeal biscuits sausage patty, breakfast potatoes, waffles bagels , evening reception 2 beverages and finger food salsa chips nachos meatballs celery/carrots and hot wings. Soda/coffee available all day  ,popcorn after 2 . Elevator had to be operated by room key and after hour entry plus pool. Pool gym and laundry room located on the 6th floor pool is nice size with jacuzzi .",1
"* I noticed that this location is often reviewed as serving ""the best gyros in town"". Could be. I can't say, as it's the only place in town where I've purchased a gyro.
* I have a bit of a sour attitude toward beef and lamb mixed and grilled together. Every time I had it as a young man, it tasted... gamey. Smelled somewhat like moist dog food.
* It's been years of avoiding gyros, until tonight. I had some time to wait here in this area, so maybe it was time to revisit the gyro from a place that seems to know what they're doing.
* Yeah. This sauce was good enough to almost make me not notice what meat I was eating. It didn't taste bad at all. I don't think it's something I will make a regular meal, as I am sensitive to dairy/cheese.",1
"I went here today because all week I've been experiencing swelling in my wrists, neck, face, achiness and burning in my arm, and generally not feeling right. I did the usual paperwork, had to pay up front, which had I been able to pay afterwards. I probably would have left and gone to Lankenau. So, the MA who came in and asked me questions was cool, personable.... My blood pressure was insanely high, which I have never experienced before (168 over 135) and I got panicky, as the alarms and crap were dinging,... The MA definitely recognized my concern, and listened pretty well. 
The Dr came in and I went  thru my list of symptoms and he totally blew me off, I  said even the fact my blood pressure was sky high wasn't a bit alarming,....He said no, I have anxiety. Made me out to be a hypochondriac, which totally isn't the case, I've fallen off rooftops and walked junk off like the queen of england. He then asks are you tired...Yeah I'm tired , I work full time in a hospital and waitress part time, and I walk like a million miles a day, but I feel crappy now more so than usual.

 He palpates my belly and asks a few more questions, then says well I think you may have mono.... But there isn't much we can do about that.... I asked if he could run an epstien barr heterophile blood test to see...He said it wasn't neccesary. Um....Ok. ""Tthere isnt much that we can do about that anyway""... Great. He says I strained my wrist. I'll get you an ace bandage....Well what about the mono possibility....ande the fact my blood pressure was insanely high....Once again he gives me this look like listen you dirty little tattooed hood rat...you have no idea what your talking about..... ""Your a perfectly healthy twenty seven year old. Your fine. You have anxiety problems, you checked off depression on your chart....."" Um. Ok. So I then wait half an hour for an ace bandage while the chick runs around bitching how they don't have any supplies, never can get anything done....(reassuring) I mean, to be fair, I probably could have gotten a better physical at my apartment considering I have a broken wheelchair,a blood pressure cuff, a buncha vacutainers, some cough syrup, and part of a trach tool kit (don't ask me and my brother work in healthcare,....and kinda hoard stuff...) So I finally get my ace bandage and ask the girl if she can take my blood pressure...SHe says she can't find a stethescope. I ask a dr passing by if he can and he pretty much laughs in my face.
""Aren't you leaving?"" 
Um, ok.
""why do you want your blood pressure checked?""
""Because it was insanely high when I came in on the machine, and I was hoping a manual read would prove different""
So, in less than good humor, he pretends like he's checking my pressure (I know how to use a blood pressure cuff, he didn't set it on the right numbers or place the stethescope in the correct area....) He says 
""It's like 110 over 90. Why, do you feel ok?""
Whatta mess. For the record, my brother and boyfriend took my pressure, it's still high, and now I'm out 70 bucks and all I got was a steam punk piece of junk arm brace that I'll probably be wearing in a casket judging by these reviews.",-1
"Mediocre at best. Service was very slow. It took 5 min. just to get a menu. Place was not very clean. Breakfast sandwich was average and breakfast burrito was not flavorful. Biscuits and gravy were tasty but again, just average.",-1
"Seooooooooooul Garden (does anyone else hear Soul Train in their head?) pretty decent Korean food, I love that you can grill at your table. Its fun, cooked the way you like it and its entertaining, but if someone doesn't like to cook, this may not be for them. Its a bit pricey, but most Korean restaurants in the area are. 

The service is hit or miss, they are never rude, they just don't come by often. My friend ordered a glass of wine, wanted a second one half way through our meal, but we couldn't get it ordered. anyways the bill showed up and the wine was $10 (for very average table wine) on the menu it stated it was $4 dollars, we asked why and we got ""oh i don't understand, so sorry"" strange, as she spoke to us in English when we ordered and asked her questions before, but by this time we were over it, paid for our meal and left.
Over all i enjoyed the food and the grilling of the BBQ but I would rather take a trip over to Charlotte Rd.",1
"My boyfriend and I ate at In Riva last night. The decor and location is great, for that I'd give it a 4 Star. 
I ordered the hangar steak starter as I wasn't ravenously hungry, and my partner ordered the margherita pizza. The service was by the way, very attentive and food arrived very fast.
My steak was raw, tough and tasteless. Inedible. I don't even think it was hangar steak, it looked more like a sirloin tip. Took me 4 minutes to chew one small piece. The salad it came with was tasty so I just ate that and told my waitress that the steak was lousy. She offered to bring me something else, but I refused.
The pizza was tasty and enjoyable, but hardly memorable. 

To In Riva's credit, they did not charge us for the steak dish.

We might give it another chance just becos we are local and becos we won't write off a place based on ordering two items. The ambiance, location, service etc will probably convince us to try again in a while.  If I could I would give it 2.5 stars.",1
"Yummy fried rice!!! That's what I thought when going to panda. My favorite thing there is the rice. I forgot panda has changed there rice recipe. It is not the same any more. In my opinion it's worst the the other way they make it:-(. 

This facility is located in a great area. There's tons of shopping around and lots to do. As for the inside of the facility, it was the same as most other chains. When walking in the tables were messy, and the line was very long. We waited for about 20 to 25 minutes. Now I think this has something to do with the food place next to it! The reason why I said that is because we went there first and they ran out of a main ingredient.  Which means better business for panda. 

As for the staff, they seemed to be dreading the day. They stuck with the bare minimum of talking with customers. ""what can I get for you.""  But then shortly after the staff started talking about personal stuff I front of customers. Now if that was me, I would prefer my personal life be private. Especially infringe of strangers! 

As for going back, I may go back when thinking of the Fried rice and forget they changed the recipe.",1
Food frozen with taste of freezer burn. Over priced for what you get. Nothing interesting everything is average food that can be purchased anyplace else for less money.  Love the interior everything else under average.,-1
"I'm going to have to return and fill this out a bit further, but I want to put a pin in it so that I don't forget, because we had a splendid meal.

Carrollton Market is on my NOLA Top 10 list.  Wow.",1
"We stopped by the Cafe to have lunch before exploring the exhibits.  The food was okay, but we were turned off by the service.  As soon as we entered, the cafe staff are just chatting by the service counter.  It took a few minutes for someone to take our order.  After we ordered our food and just as we were about to sit down, one of the service people made a sarcastic comment about us getting our food free that made me feel uncomfortable.  I guess the lady at the counter forgot to ring up my husband's sandwich.  

Throughout our meal, we could clearly hear the cafe staff gossiping and saying bad things about their coworker. So what would have been a somewhat enjoyable meal, was pretty miserable listening to people complain about each other.  If you have to gossip about your coworker behind their back, please go somewhere where customers cannot hear you.  

Other than that, the food was okay. Nothing spectacular.  I ordered a half club sandwich with a cup of broccoli and cheese soup.  The sandwich was decent, but the soup had an off-putting taste.  My husband's salad was good and I wish I had ordered that instead.  

I'll probably eat at the Cafe again, but sit closer to the counter as to avoid all the inter-cafe gossip.",1
"People have been recommending we try this place for years.  We finally stopped in this weekend for the Sunday Brunch.  The location and setting are beautiful.  The Sunday brunch costs about $33 per person, and it includes a buffet, made to order menu, and unlimited mimosas.  The price is great for the amount of food; however, the quality of the food was just above average.  The servers continually brought out the wrong orders to our table, and we waited 20 minutes after being seated before our server came over to the table.  If I am going to be in the area for brunch, I would prefer to pay $55 per person for Oystercatchers, where the quality of food and service is much higher, and the setting is equally beautiful.",1
tonight was first time we ate there we ordered out last time we left happy just like when we got there and we were full!!!! My wife suggested next time we go we will just have dessert,1
"For a casual burger place, 500 degrees delivers on taste, quality, service and speed. You can get a 5 star burger in a 3 star amount of time. It's so impressive.

Their selection is truly outstanding. You have your choice of patties, cheeses, toppings and condiments to build whatever burger your heart desires. I believe there are some suggestions as well if you're not feeling particularly creative that day. 

The last time we were there, my boyfriend got the Kobe beef burger, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, a fried egg and Vermont cheddar cheese. He was knocked to the floor, and has been telling everyone about it ever since. I got a simple beef patty with cheese and BBQ sauce. Maybe I need to be a bit more adventurous next time! Nonetheless, I still loved my burger.

Another great thing about 500 Degrees is the option to get your fries with truffle oil. It's just a little extra flavor added to already spectacular crispy French fries. 

I've always had stellar service here. I loved joking around with the woman who served us last time about coming through hell and high water for an as yet undetermined burger since we had come in out of a torrential downpour and it took me 10 minutes to decide what I wanted off of the menu. I blame it on the rain brain.

My only gripe about 500 Degrees is that it can get a little pricey. For burgers, fries and drinks for 2, we paid about $28. That included one Kobe beef patty, but even without it, you're going to pay a sit-down price for what is really a take-out burger. The quality justifies this in many ways, so we'll definitely be back. Save your pennies and splurge!",1
"I took my wife and two boys to Phat BItes for an early dinner on a Tuesday.  We've been to Ellendales and the old Phat Bites location numerous times, but this was our first trip to the new location.  The space is cool and the bar is a nice addition.  Food was good as usual.... BUT, our experience ordering our meal was absolutely miserable.  Not sure i can capture how bad the exchange was in this review, but it ended with my wife feeling confused and uncomfortable, and myself literally asking the employee ""how difficult can this be?""  That employee took what should have been a 4 star experience and made it a 2 star experience.  The employee was quizzing us on the menu, not providing any answers and not being helpful in the least.  So I checked Yelp and it appears others have had similar experiences.  Phat Bites should be a 4 to 5 star restaurant on Yelp.  It is 3.5 largely because of bad service.  Tighten it up PB",-1
"This has been our go to pizza and wing place for years...we would drive 15 minutes for pick up because we lived where they didn't deliver. Now I live about 5 minutes away. Anyway the wings in the mild sauce are awesome...that mild sauce goes awesome with there buffalo chicken cheese steak or pizza. There fries are not my favorite because they are never crunchy but my family likes them. There BBQ chicken pizza is very good and not what you would get in any other pizza place (no red sauce). The chicken Caesar salad is HUGE, you get a ton of chicken...I've recently noticed they have had a price 
increase, which isn't good, but they put pretty good food out so I'll keep going there.",1
"Overall, for the price, I was unimpressed with this hotel. I've had larger rooms, a better view, and better service at much cheaper places. Granted, it is a great location for business in downtown Edmonton, but I would rather walk a few extra blocks to the office than stay here again.

Major complaints: 
-the wait for the elevator in the morning was over 10 minutes. I finally ended up taking the stairs, which exit onto the street, and re-entering the hotel from the front to get to breakfast.
-the soundproofing is poor in the guest rooms. Noise from the elevators, other guest rooms, maid service, etc. was clearly heard in the room throughout the night

Minor complaints: 
-the TV remote was complicated to work, and I had to get 'tech support' to come fix it
-the sheets aren't great; a hotel of this 'caliber' could provide a better thread count
-the view is awful. I get that it's in downtown, but the roof of a building isn't a great view. Worse, the building had skylights, and the lights inside the building shone out all night, right through the curtains.
-The room was tiny, and definitely showing signs of wear. Even small repairs, such as the caulking around the tub and grout in the bathroom, do not say 'boutique hotel' but 'DIY renovations'

Positives:
-the staff were friendly, although the entire interaction was very scripted both at check-in and check-out
-the breakfast is included, and was fairly decent, even had some hot items which I did not have. yogurt, granola, fruit, pastries, cereal, juice, etc.
-there were lots of pillows, and the wireless worked well.

In conclusion, I would prefer to pay less and feel like I was getting good value than to pay this much and feel like it was a rip-off, despite the great location.",-1
"I have never had a bad experience at this sonic. The carhops are always friendly and our food always comes out how we order it. Last time, it took about 5 minutes for them to bring out 2 drinks. To make up for it, they gave us tokens for 2 free rt 44 drinks!",1
Waited longer then we were told. We could not carry  our bar check to our table we were told it's easier for bartender if we just pay it separate.  Staff seemed a little overwhelmed but nice and they were working hard.  Excellent beer selection. Food was good but not much quantity and the amount if fries was comical maybe 8! And the quality was not sufficient to make up for the quantity. Our one burger was under cooked the waiter did get a new burger but then we had to wait and watch my son eat it. My second time there and they  left me with no real reason to go return.,-1
"I love the recliners. They are very comfortable, however it's a bit gross when you have to clean up other people's trash and tissues before sitting. Before the movie started I saw the employee go in with a dust pan but not sure what he did. The floor was full of popcorn and trash, the cup holders were wet and contained trash, the seats had tissues and napkins stuffed in the seats. The lobby was even dirty as was the bathroom. It was a big trade off for reclining seats.",-1
"Went here because my mother-in-law goes here and I'm in town visiting. When we arrived, I told one of the techs there what I needed (a fill, 1 nail repair and gel polish). She told me to pick a color; I did and had a seat to wait. There were 5 techs seeing 5 customers so clearly I knew there was a wait. Instead of telling me to either come back or give me an estimated time it would be until I was seen, one tech told me to have a seat at a station. She then began to set the station up as if she were getting ready to start my service. Instead, she set the station up, then walked BACK to her client and continued their service and just had me waiting...what? Why not tell me to come back in a few hours or tomorrow or simply let me know how long it would be. I've always had a tech communicate with these things with a client. Customer service alone, it was NOT a good experience for me.",-1
Good food but terrible service. Wait was crazy and there were open tables.  Not a good place to eat at if you have kids!!,-1
"Hotels atmosphere is great!! Their restaurant's  food is a typical diner. My waitress was very friendly, although the manager was a  My card was not working, so...

"For those of you (possibly the select few) that don't know Gillane's has been under new management since the summer, EVERYTHING is different, and will remain in transformation for what seems to be awhile now. With that being said the food has now evolved into a spectacular meal that is no long ""so-so"" (and without changing the menu might I add). And how could you forget those crazy clowns? Well now you can! Because not a single one is in sight and they can no longer stare at you while you eat (and I swear I saw one of them move awhile ago). But not only are the disappearance of the clowns a change, but there are gorgeous flat screen TV's down at the bar that if the food doesn't make you drool those will! With new silverware, glassware, plates, placemats and booths Gillane's seems to only be getting STARTED with it's renovations. So I will definitely be coming back not only for the new and improved great food but also to see what's next!",1
"Over priced medicore bar food. 

They have a new menu. The menu on their website contained some better options. The new slimmed down menu has fewer and much less appealling offerings. It is now just over priceded bar food. Nothing special here. Burgers, wings, salads and mediocre sushi. Blah.",-1
"I did not want to post this on Yelp.  But after a surprisingly unconcerned and deflective conversation with the management of the Sandpiper Lodge here it is:

I stayed in room 239 at the Sandpiper Lodge in Santa Barbara on 5-20 and 5-21- 2011.  Today, 5-27-2011, my physician has informed me that I am hosting SCABIES.   I am a married, 44 year-old, home-owner.  I did not do anything risky or unusual in the last month, or for many months (sigh).  I offer this information to all readers of yelp to draw their own conclusions.   Of course, I'm not using my real name here on the Internet, but there are hotel and medical records that will confirm all the relevant facts.",-1
"The service was not bad, it did however have a line that went out the door. I suggest going here for your morning coffee and cookie fix.",1
"Horrible place to live. Horrible customer service. They powerwashed the roof and slug came thru our A/C and stained the carpet and they have yet to come clean it up after a month. Zero lights at night so have fun walking up the stairs with your groceries. There are so many choices in this area for apts, KEEP LOOKING ELSE WHERE!!!! Even if there is a good price, they will increase the rent after one year by 20-40 percent, so if you like moving and packing up all your furniture n clothes, then move right in. If you're looking for a place to live where rent wont increase and force you to move out, then PASS ON CAMDEN BAY!!! Id recommend checking out Westchase area apts. Its a much nicer area, with all the amenities you need.",-1
My first creole experience in louisiana . I ordered dozen raw oysters and my Bf ordered the creole trio. Jambalaya is different here more wet and dark red. I really liked it the sausages in the rice were yum andouille . The gumbo and red beans I didn't care for. My oysters were good they were huge and the sauces were spicy like I like it. The red sauce it comes with is mediocre taste but wasn't too spicy the green jalapeño Tabasco has a real kick to it wasabi a big dash I might add. Overall a 3.5 or almost a4 experience,1
"After a 90-min wait (we were told it would be an hour), I went for dinner with my sisters. The food was just okay and over-priced. The polenta wasn't the best I've had, the cheese empanadas were not empanadas but rather fried little puff balls (and if they're going to be vegetarian, there should more more, not less of the meat ones), the cauliflower was pretty good but again, not worth the price. 

But let me tell you about our service! First the server brought out the wrong wine for my sisters (they got a red cab Mendoza, a white Chardonnay was delivered). Nobody really checked on us except to ask if we wanted to order more food. Then! One of my sisters PULLED A REALLY LONG HAIR OUT OF HER MOUTH AFTER TAKING A BITE OF FOOD!!!!!!!! When we alerted our server, his response was, ""ew, I'll be sure to tell the chef.""

NEVER did we get an apology, nor was the item replaced nor taken off the check!!!!! And on top of that, he charged us for the red AND the white wine!!!!! The sister who had the hair is super polite and it was impressive that she even alerted him of the hair, so unfortunately she did not fight to have the item taken off, regardless of my urging her to do so. Alas, I decided to share this review. That hair was LONG AND NASTY! 

No way will I return. What a shame.",-1
"I chose this place on vacation because of the great reviews and I was not disappointed.  Not only was the food great (I got a margherita pizza and also tried the farmers market sandwich), but the service was also impeccable. All of the employees were so kind and I ended up sitting next to what I presume is one of the owners - he was very friendly and interested in what I had to say about the meal! I will definitely be visiting Newk's when one opens in my town!",1
"Man, it has been a long time. My first encounter with this pub was back in 1991 in my Navy days. Some friends of mine and I were cramming nachos and margaritas at Los Amigos (which I am not sure exists still), and being silly sailors at the bar. He sits next to us and he invites our rowdy foursome for a drink on him at his place down the way, Brownies. He had us squids at ""drink on him"".

Decor was comfy and easygoing, and I see it hasn't changed. Service was friendly and fun. Drinks we paid for were good and not too pricey. We came back several times and always left pretty happy. Maybe someday soon I will darken Brownie's door and relive them good times.",1
"Restaurant was totally empty for lunch today and hostess refused to seat my wife and child for lunch, saying the tables were all reserved.  What a joke.  Good business idea",-1
"Stopped in for dinner and the first thing we noticed is the bar with nothing on tap uhhh wtf they also sat three of us at a table for two. We had the nachos and empanadas and they were both delicious but the empanadas would be better paired with a cilantro type sauce than the remoulad it came with and the nachos were super crispy but lacked chicken.  For meals we had the gyro meatball which was a fail you just don't get a bite of meat with every bite and it lacked taziki. However, the chicken and waffles were good.For desert I had the Duncan Hines chocolate cake and it literally taste like box nothing to write home about. Final note the 2 $$ are not accurate it should easily be $$$",1
"We have come here many times, this time we came in around 1pm & the place was packed. I think they were a little under staffed. There was no hostess when we got there because she was to busy cleaning. Olivia was our server & had just transferred from another store but did pretty good. We had mozz sticks, boneless (all you can eat) special & a margarita. All was ok,     We have never really experienced a problem here & it is close to home.",1
"My friend and I had dinner here on Sunday. I was surprised to be seated next to another party on the same table with just a small partition separating us. This is how some of the tables are if you are a party of 4 or less. The restaurant is small and can get loud. We had very good service. The food was ok, we got the Kale Ceaser and the Fried chicken with mac n cheese. They were out of watermelon so the salad that was supposed to come with the chicken had to be changed to something else. I was impressed with the soft egg that came with Kale ceaser, it was nicely encased in a crispy crust and the yolk was nice and runny.",1
"I was not impressed with much here. Ordered the Longhorn and fries. Firstly they two beers that my friend and I wanted to try were out. We were served room temperature water and the bottled soda I ordered was also room temp. 

The burgers are small and didn't really taste better than something I could make at home. Lacking in flavor and overall taste. he ambiance is nice but I was disappointed overall by the burgers. 

The best thing I ordered was the peanut butter ice cream.",-1
I'm not sure why this hospital has not such a good rep. I love this hospital the people are nice.  I never have too long of a wait like other hospitals.  & the parking lot is a 5star all in itself because its so close to the hospital.  I've had my gallbladder removed from this hospital.  I was well taken care of,1
Food is so good!  We ordered the pollo fundido and the nachos supremos. Service was polite and efficient. Make a stop on your way to Bill Jackson's!  I would love to see them open a second restaurant or move this one somewhere more visible. It's easy to drive past and would require quite a bit of back tracking to get there.,1
"We go to Sizzler in Sparks at least once a month - its always great. 
Around $40.00 for 2 people. But a gut buster - you wont leave hungry.
You have got to go if for no other reason then to try the amazing cheesy toast they bring every table while you wait for your food! 

Go for the steak and all-you-can eat fried shrimp! Its great but my favorite is the amazing salad bar..... normally thats all I get because it has so much! 

If you can think of a topping for a salad they have it out, and everything is always fresh and wonderful. They have mountains of fresh fruit also! Plus they have the tostada bar - tacos, taco salads - and DONT FORGET to grab a few of those wonderful fried chicken wings they totally ROCK! Also the pizza is pretty good. I think they also have soup but I havent tried that yet - no room!!!
Then there is a desert/ice cream bar to top it all off!

The ONLY thing i have found that I dislike about this place is the drinking glasses are VERY small - which annoys me because I feel bad about constantly having to ask for a refill - I'm not sure if the little glasses are so the wait staff gets BIG tips - but it definatly works because once I make the poor server bring me 10 refills I feel almost obligated to leave a fat tip! I've been considering bring in my OWN big glass and save the poor person so many trips - but that would be kind of ghetto right? Hahaha

Go to Sizzler its GREAT!!!",1
"We came in the early afternoon, probably after 2, and were the only 2 people in the store. I believe it was the proprietor that politely greeted us, letting us know that they were open, and welcoming us. I like the shelf on the wall with NOLA paraphernalia, bottles of hot sauce, and the awards they've won. The uniform of black pinched fedoras made me miss my old job at the hat store... just a little. 

Solid fried chicken. Reminds me of my dad's best friend's pizza shop in East Los Angels (R.I.P. Rocky's Pizza), as in lightly floured and then fried so that the crispness is all in the skin, no breading.

The cornbread was delicious, not too dry, with a serving of unnecessary whipped butter that I used anyway. Red beans were terrible. Simply too thick with the consistency of refried beans, and no flavor; I had to add so much freaking hot sauce and it just got absorbed. The collards were alright; tender but still somewhat bitter. 

Contrary to other reviews, I thought the service was fine, although just a little slow. The server came out to tell us exactly how much longer the chicken would be (which showed to me that they prepared it right when we ordered). We had no wait time, again, because we came in off-hours, yet a few more customers did trickle in after us. 

Did not get to check out the candy shop but I will next time.",1
I didn't really like my sandwich I got here. I got the jalapeño cheese bread and it was tasteless and dry. I could tell it was old. Also I got tomatoes and cucumbers which were mush because they were overripe. Usually they're a lot better than this but today wasn't it. The staff is very friendly though.,-1
Wait staff was pleasant but food took forever even though it wasn't remotely busy. Burger bun too soggy .....fries have a funky dust on them. Everything was super salty or greasy.   What is all the hype about?   Not cheap either.  Terrible.  Stay away.  Seriously.   BTW.  Two hours later and my husband and I are both feeling queasy. Thank goodness for Alka Seltzer,-1
"We have loved Schlafly for many years as we lived just blocks away and love their beer and food. So, when we had guests in town, we decided to drive a bit and take them to Bottleworks on a nice fall day to enjoy a few drinks before dinner at our place. What in the heck happened to this place? Saturday afternoon, the patio was about 2/3 full, but we got a 30-45 minute wait for 15 people including a few babes. On top of that, we were told we had to order food if we sat on the patio. Fine, we will order a few appetizers. Nope, it had to be entrees. After promising to make it up to the server and tip well, we were given a pager. Waited 45 minutes to be seated as we watched tables sit empty. Once seated, some of our group ordered entrees because the server made them feel bad, so that made the meal I already had prepared completely worthless. The topper was when we got our checks, the server told us we were not as bad as she expected and to come back again when we got babysitters for the babies. So is there some new trend in hospitality to treat your guests like this that should make them want more? 
I do hold a special place in my heart for this place as we used to walk there with our kids all the time and even hit up their markets and other events, but I was so embarrassed for talking this place up the way I did and actually driving more than a mile to go here. Surely, Schlafly realizes that there is another great brewery right down the street that has a much better vibe and appreciation for their guests. Live and learn.",-1
"Food was decent. I ordered the chicken with potatoes. The potatoes tasted weird and had like a weird tangy flavor. Chicken was dry and salty. Waiter was charming but bad with filling up water. He would fill one cup up and leave the others empty for no reason. Also had a very small selection. Though, I tried my brothers hamburger and it was outstanding! Children may not like this place but it'll be fine for adults unless you're picky.",1
"Two of us came in at 6pm on a Friday. I wish they would rearrange the entrance and the way guests are greeted. I was standing basically in the middle of the restaurant next to a couple's dinner table. Three people asked me my name after finally seating us. 

We brought two bottles of wine which they kept in the back. I read some reviews stating that the servers get snappy when you don't choose to order a dish from each section. This is 100% false. Our waitress simply told us how large dishes are and based on how hungry we are, we may not want all of the courses. We both started with the beet steak. Ugh amazinggggg, very savory, unlike any beet dish I've had before. If you like beets, I highly recommend this. For my main, I had bass with red quinoa (i think). It was very fresh and the portion was average for nicer restaurants. We shared the chocolate hazelnut and caramel torte which was divine.

My major down side was the wine. There were so many times when our glass was empty for more than 10 minutes. If you're busy that's completely fine. I would have liked our wine on the table. 

I'd love to stop in again since they have a rotating menu.",1
This has been one of my favorite chains for a while. I will not visit this one again. Slowest service I can remember anywhere. Food was cold when I got it. I will not be returning.,-1
"Fast, efficient service. Tasty coffee. No complaints on my visit. 

I wouldn't want to be in the drive thru.... Must have been a line 15 cars long. Hello people! Walk your buns inside!",1
Went here to try out the two basketball courts I saw listed......waste of my time. Neither one is playable and both have been seriously neglected. All of the rims are very crooked and bent down significantly. The pavement hasn't been redone in years and has grass growing throughout it. Hopefully they put the time into redoing it because a decent outdoor court in this area would be great addition to the park.,-1
"As much as I adore food I am, typically, pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, ""Please hold"" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL.
My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL.
I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.  In retrospect, I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong.
I would not frequent this restaurant again even if I had a free coupon. Don't waste your time or energy.",-1
"This has been a favorite shopping place for me, but NO MORE.  They have consistently raised prices with quality going down.  Have found NOTHING the last several times I've been there.  Small Christmas decoration .98.  This is a thrift store not Dillard's.  Customer base has changed drastically.  Will look elsewhere.",-1
Thought it was nasty. Didn't like the sauce and hated the cheese. I've never not liked cheese but this tasted like cheese whiz on a pizza. It was gross!,-1
"Four stars for decor and craft beer selection. Two stars for food. This place does shine like a diamond in the rough. I'm not too familiar with Philly, but the bar flanked parts of Chinatown and seemed to be in a part of town that was a bit rough-around-the -edges, so finding this cool spot in such a unlikely locale made it ever more of a sweet find. From the vintage sign outside to the wrought iron mustang carved enclosures that meet you at the front entrance, a subtlely hip James Dean appeal imbued the Prohibition.  The vibe, beer, and service did not disappoint, so I expected their grub to live up. I was excited to see their pickle plate as an app and ordered it on a whim. Luscious looking carrots and cocktail onions and green beans came out on an equally verdant and zesty looking bed of fresh lettuce, but after my second bite I realized that looks can be deceiving. Let's just say this app tasted more like a vinegar plate than a pickled veg plate.  The veggie sandwich tasted overly seasoned and a few bites in, I couldn't even finish it.  I almost would have rather they served a Boca Burger and least gotten something somewhat tasty for my money. And then a quarter of the way through our sandwich, a slightly off cook (the head cook?) came out from the kitchen and kept offering the bartenders food, only to be turned down. And they seemed annoyed by her persistence. Weird. The whole situation was odd and made me wish I had only stopped at the Prohibition for a drink and gone somewhere else for food.",-1
"Wow ,shocked.This Restaurant is not ready for service.When 15 min early we were treated as if we were morons,as the young hostess huffed and brought us to the bar with an empty restaurant,why not or table.The feeling of the place was confusion,late employees running into the dining room making it known that they were late without uniforms on ect.three of them talking on their phones in the dining room,Rookie night ,what a joke.The food was of Olive Garden level if that.To top it off was our walk back to our hotel on St.Charles,as we walk along the side of the restaurant we encounterd three employees smoking what my wife says was weed.We also came across the most disgusting smell that allmost brought our dinner back up.It smelled like dead rats and an overflowing used rancid cooking oil ,as we looked behind their wall that seperate the side walk we witnessed the filthiest ,overflowing dumpster and overflowing spent cooking oil and filth about this small corner section on Jackson ave.We avoid the French Quarter for this very reason.I would be very frightened to see the kitchen.The restrooms were not very clean at all ,bad food is one thing but bad sanitation is deadly.My advice ,stay far away for at least 6 months .BTW we checked their sanitation reports with the City of new Orleans,MAJOR  Violations.They should be ashamed of themselves.",-1
"Long time regular of Hooters in the Florida and now defunct Ohio areas and had to visit this one when visiting friends in Arizona.   Ordered a pitcher of beer and 10 minutes later told I cannot have one alone.  That's ok   I remember living in Ohio the Hooters up there never gave someone drinking solo a pitcher   was just policy    even seen same policy in some Tampa stores   AFTER THIS ALL DOWNHILL.   Waitress must have thought we were mad and sent a manager over    I explained it is no problem and I seen the policies before   he then corrected saying it is a state law in a firm tone.  Ok  I was educated   very cool    he then had to be a know it all and tell me that the Hooters ANYWHERE never had a policy about pitcher serving and he knew cause he worked with the company 10 years.   LISTEN  NOW YOU MADE AN ISSUE OF A NON ISSUE,   it was the way they were in Columbus ohio!!!!!   Experienced it many times  I Did not care for the vinegar based hot sauce, and  then mr ""know it all"" had to speak up again saying Florida will be switching soon from butter to vinegar so get used to it.  Have since found from 2 Florida IMPORTANT HOOTERS MANAGEMENT PEOPLE that 1  they will never change over and 2 Other one says they are really fighting it.  The outspokeness of this manager really ruined a visit and overshadowed our very nice and sweet waitress    she was one of twins   cannot remember name though.  Beautiful store just try not to engage manager  #WillRegret",-1
"This is one of those times I wish Yelp allowed us 1/2 ratings because I would give this place 3 1/2 stars. I think Zea is all about bang for your buck -- it's not very expensive and you get a ton of decent food. Nothing very creative, but solid food. However, the service needs vast improvement. But I'd return because the prices are extremely reasonable. Atmosphere is decent.",1
"This was the second time coming here.  First time we came the wait for a drink (only got a drink) was quite long.  The second time coming was for dinner.  I personally ordered a Johnny Blaze...this was good; however, the burger was half the size of the bun...So I feel like I just got one slider and a handful of fries.  The other order was a Ruuurouper (grouper tacos) which was sooooo rubbery tasting I actually spit it out.   It seemed as though I was gnawing on my tire.  It's unfortunate as the ambiance is pretty decent and wait staff was attentive.",1
"Inexpensive, but needs some improvement.

Being one of the cheapest Wyndham hotels in the St. Louis area, I thought I'd give this Super 8 a shot. 

Checking in was fine, but as soon as I got to the stairwell, I noticed a very musty smell. The second floor hallway wreaked of smoke, even though smoking was supposedly not allowed. 

The room gave mixed impressions. The bed was nice, but the closest power outlet was literally attached to the wall with a piece of scotch tape. I tried plugging my phone in for a charge and it kept falling out. 

Checkout was very slow. Usually Wyndham properties allow express checkout, but not here. After waiting for about 15 minutes, the lady at the desk prints my receipt, only to walk away and say she'll be right back. I guess she went to check that the room was left in good enough condition to return the security deposit. Either way, it was one of the slowest checkouts I've ever had. 

If you're looking for a budget stay and won't mind a few of the issues listed above, then you may be fine staying here for a night.",-1
Let me start by saying I'm from philadelphia so I've never had shrimp & grits together! It was AMAZINGGGGG. The food came out quickly and our waitress was a sweetie. Definitely worth the walk from the French quarter.,1
"Haven't been to a Philllip's in a long, long time. So when work took me to the Sheraton in Philly I thought it was time to reacquaint myself with my childhood seafood place... Bad idea.

The crab cakes I remembered as delicious morsels of ambrosia turned out to be overly greasy, too little crab, and much too little taste. At least they were edible. The grilled snapper (fish of the day) and asparagus that I got on the side were overcooked and drowned in butter as if this could hide the unmistakable blandness of the food.

I was quite literally crushed. Hoping this is was symptomatic of the location and not the chain. Will have to try the one in Baltimore and pray that it lives up to my childhood memories.",-1
"BEWARE before you are the next victim! Firestone burned out a cylinder  in a brand new starter on a 2004 Mercedes Benz C230, by the mechanics that dont know what they are doing costing me an extra $500.00 plus, $460.00, with an alternator from AUTO ZONE which is no good and don't last long. I had the starter replaced at Kaufman about a year ago. I have contacted 8 ON MY SIDE and BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU for an investigation on  these dishonest and untruthful employee at Firestone. The car started 3 times at Firestone location with no issues with my starter, after being towed.. The next day I had received a call from an employee about my car's starter was smoking after they repaired an alternator and battery. I wonder what Firestone did to my car.  I had reported that an alternator that was done at Firestone was giving lot of problem 6 months ago, with no help and resolution. I will NEVER return to any Firestone or Firestone on Bruce B. Downs and I am disappointed and filing a complaint for justice.",-1
"This was our second trip to Yogi Elmer, NJ. Water wars is always fun ( for kids & adults) we brought a trailer w a huge water tank hitched to a pickup. There are a ton of teams that battle through the campground and at the water wars and that part is a blast!!! The pool at this facility is just screaming bacteria!!' To say it was cloudy would be an understatement! You couldn't see your hand in an inch of water! They must shock the pool each morning or evening unsure but I don't suggest adults or children to go in unless you're life goal would be to have E. coli or a skin disease. There were actual guests taking home pool samples to be tested LOL clearly this was a problem for a large # of guests! 

Bathroom cleanliness improved from last year. Check in time took some time however it was due to waivers required to be assigned by each camper. There were no waivers last year so this was new. 

They are pretty stern with quiet hour. At one point my girlfriend was told by security she ""wasn't permitted to laugh while riding her bike to the bathroom"". No golf carts after 11 and they are very strict with this rule. We had a child who was in a wheelchair with our group and we had to get into the car to take him to the bathroom in the middle of the night & early morning. From a safety stand point you would think they'd prefer you drive a golf cart vs your big truck w trailer through the park but that's just my personal opinion. 

With all that being said, kids had a blast! Bring DEET/Deep Woods bug spray bc this location has mutant Mosquitos that will make its purpose to eat your children alive given the chance.  Site 218 had sand flees, per the campers, avoid this site at all cost! Lol 

Staff/Security were extremely helpful and friendly. They deliver wood & ice directly to your site, new and great feature!",1
"Ok going into this review, know hat I have never liked their beer.  For some reason it does not taste very good.  I knew this before walking in, but I wanted to give them a fair shake at the ""new"" brewery.   I tried to keep an open mind and tried the Westport Wheat, and the Red IPA.  I was not impressed by either.  

I know again the place is new, but there was no personality to it, it was too sterile.  Everything looked great, but boring.  I did not stay long, find there was nothing there for me.  I tried to give a fair chance to them, but was honestly disappointed.",-1
"Usually great but today's visit missed the mark. My biscuit was cold, dry and hard.  The cashier was nice but the drive through service was much slower than usual. Not a great start to the morning but I hope this is the exception rather than the rule. 

Update: Another dry, cold, hard chicken biscuit. Cheese didn't even melt the biscuit was so cold. Cold hash browns. Missed again.",-1
Not too bad but pretty pricy for what it is. Basic fried fish - hard to mess that up unless you're using bad fiah! Considering they are in the heart of the bayou I expected nothing less than fresh. About $25 per person without alcohol.,1
"We were told to go here by a friend. They did not disappoint. The food was fresh, fast and delicious. Super huge portions too big for me. Wish they had half portions -- ended up throwing most of mine away and felt wasteful. But if you are a big eater go for it.",1
"Haven't eaten the food here - just stopped by for the bar.

I showed up here at around 1am on Saturday for a friend's birthday, and had a damn good time. The bartender was great - I ordered a long island and she warned me that they are huge and $13. When I told her I didn't want to spend that much, she wasn't offended and actually made me a modified drink with 151 that cost $8 but packed the punch of a long island. There was a $10 minimum for credit cards so the bartender gave me a beer in addition, which I gave to a friend. The tab came to $10 even - the beer was just $2 - and I was a very happy camper as I slurped down my drink.

The music was great, and I loved the tiny dance floor - it was packed and everybody was having a great time. I would come back here again for the very strong drinks and fun dancing (and I don't dance...)",1
"The food here is tasty - love the brisket and the cheese grits. BUT - we have had terrible luck with take out. Tried it three times, and an item was missing every time. A disappointing blemish on an otherwise fine restaurant.",-1
"I will get straight to the point..... If you are ever anywhere near Camden NJ, In fact if you are anywhere in the State of NJ, get to Santana's for breakfast and pastries.   Their coffee puts Starbucks, DD, Micky D's and all the rest to shame!!   Their pastries are INCREDIBLE!!  You would have to fly to Boricua ( Puerto Rico) to even come close!!    My business is in neighboring Pennsauken, and we are there every morning!!!",1
"This restaurant is a nice place to go and sit down to have something to eat. I've ate just about everything they have on the menu and I'd say their burgers are great. Although their pizza is a bit on the tough side I still manage to eat the crust too. 

Very comfortable dining room area as well!",1
"Beware that this place charges $18 per day for parking and a ""resort fee"" of $15 for internet access, 2 bottles of water a day and on line access to a newspaper site. I reserved our room on line, and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page, where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee, but fails to mention the $18 parking fee. 

This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I've stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice, if not better, for far less. 

I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.

When I pay $250 a night for a room, I don't expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels.",-1
"We arrived at 5:30, planning to make a 7:30 show at the Saenger, a 5 minute walk away. After 15 minutes we had to ask for a menu, adding that we had 7:30 show tickets. (and yes, there were very few diners there that early so I don't know WHAT was going on) Everything seemed slow, after an hour and 15 minutes our entrees arrived, but they forgot one of the sides. When it finally arrived it was so late we didn't have time to eat it, and we barely made our theater date on time. Some of the food was quite good but we were so stressed out by timing we didn't really enjoy it. I would give them some time to work the bugs out, especially if you're on a schedule.",-1
"We see Dr. Gloudemans, and she's a wonderful doctor. Friendly, upbeat, up on the most recent research, and pro-vaxx (hooray!!). She's proactive about problems after making sure things are worth worrying about-- ""let's keep an eye on this, and if there's still a problem in a month or two, come back in and we'll see about a referral to a specialist.""

As others have mentioned, we've had a few billing hiccups. We received a bill saying we were past due on 3 appointments' fees, despite paying all copays in the office. Luckily it was all straightened out after a phone call, but it's been frustrating on that front.",-1
"I love El Sitio...in Isla Vista. I ordered a burrito with avocado, was charged extra for the avocado, and drove to work to eat a burrito with no avocado in it. The horchata was watery and not worth it. Try the El Sitio in Isla Vista: they are much more on top of it and the quality is better.",1
"Having never done one of these things, I was thinking it was the Escape the Room thing that I have been hearing about.  As my son put it, ""this was like a county fair and the other one is like Disney.""  We used a Groupon for this. I wish that they would have notified us that it is nearly Impossible to complete the puzzle with only 4 people.  The guy in charge was nice and tried to help by giving us clues along the way, but to no avail.",1
Any hotel near the Opryland Hotel automatically loses a star.  Why else would anyone stay in this part of Nashville unless you need access to Opryland or Opry Mills Mall?  This Radisson is directly next door to the Opryland Hotel.  So there is your access.  They use a bus to shuttle every half hour.  That's convenient.  The hotel can be found online far cheaper than Opryland Hotel.  It's clean and the renovations are done.  That said-the place is spiffy with what I consider small basic rooms and small small shower area. There is a cool restaurant with live music over dinner.  Not Vegas but nice anyway.   Some of the rooms face the inner atrium.  My room faced the opposite way towards the street.  So I heard cars and trucks go by in the morning.  I can say the staff was nice and the room was clean.  Lots of restaurants in the area if you don't want hotel food.  Normally I'd say 3 stars but it's basically the freckled face stepchild of the beauty next door.  If you are just there to shop at the mall for a couple of days.  It's the way to go.,1
"Oh, Garden Bakery has been one of those restaurants it seems I've been going to for a long time. The place to go for noodles after an evening event where you didn't eat enough. The last visit was after a Zumba event so we were hungry for some grub! Some things don't change, the cleaning the table with a cloth after pouring the leftover tea on the table, and looking and wiping your tea cup and bowl with a napkin before using. 

The menu has a lot of dishes from wonton and noodle soup, rice, and entrees to go with the rice. For 4 of us, we ordered 3 entrees and that was more than enough food. I had the beef brisket chow mein and it was a large plate filled with noodles, beef, and veggies. For just over $10, it was more than a meal for one. Service primarily consisted of bringing menus, taking order, and brining food and drinks. I think we helped ourselves to the take out containers close to our booth table. 

We paid at the cashier area and made our way out with our leftovers. Walking to the car, there were a number of people that would have happily taken out leftovers if we didn't want them.

Next time we want a late night snack and in the area, will probably come here for the cheap food and large portions but not expecting much else.",1
"State Street Kitchen of Newtown, PA - a fantastic experience of warmth and engagement and yes, the breakfast was nicely done and affordable. The owner, upon presenting the menu said, if you don't see what you want simply ask. I asked her favorite and she prepared a special omelette. 

The outside looks like a piece of crap but the inside was quaint and professional. Misha, the owner, shared a selfie with me and one of the patrons came over to our table, after he finished his meal, and jawboned with us about the local community lore. 

True engagement, Priceless!  I will be back.

"Order on a piece of paper, pay at the front, and keep walking to pick your order: Fast service!!

Had the cheese and chips. Can't let the cheese sit too long but it is pretty good.

Had the Beef Enchilada plate. It was pretty good. The beans are a bit dry and the rice could be hard so just focus on the enchiladas because they are good and you will enjoy it.

Soda fountain so drink to your heart's content.",1
"Went there after work. Beer selection was good. We skipped the shrimp cocktail. Filet looked great. Tasted bland. Not sure how you can mess it up, but I wasn't impressed. I also didn't like the mushrooms side order. Sat outside on a nice evening. It's on the corner which could make for decent people watching.",1
"If I could give this subway 0 stars, I would. The only reason I'm not overcome with guilt of misleading people with the extra star is because once in a while, once you suffer through the ordering experience, the food is somewhat tasty. Sometimes. 

I am surprised to see more reviewers didn't comment specifically on the chain smoking, smug, openly mocking rude sandwich maker that seems to always be the only employee. A few did, but not all. 

This man COMPLETELY ruins the subway experience. He laughs at you the whole time you order, moves so slow, doesn't respond when spoken to, and gives the most disturbing looks. I do not understand how he keeps his job, unless he's also the owner, and in that case I don't understand how he runs the business.

Go to the wawa up the street if you need a fresh hoagie.",-1
"I wasn't really impressed. When I got to the counter, the cashier barely even looked at me. I had to ask him if he was ready for my order. I ran next door to pick up the take out dinner I had order while my donuts were being prepared and they almost didn't let me back in because they were closing and thought I was a new customer. The donuts were good and I appreciate them being fresh but waiting for each one to be made makes for a long wait. Plus, they are all the same base. No chocolate donut or cream filled, etc. I'd probably just go to Dunkin next time for the variety and speed.",-1
"We decide to make it a ""once a year trip at least"" from the Orlando area.
This place will scare for the amount of people that will pass through. Don't let it. It's well organized.
Just decided what you want pick a number and they will serve you within 5 mins top.
We bought 5/6 cheeses  a couple of dry meats and a bottle of Cannonau wine.
Enjoyed it in the patio and left after closing the brunch with an amaretto ball and a sfogliatella.
Buy sfogliatelle before they are gone. They run out in less than 1/2 hours.
So worth it!",1
"A good red sauce kind of place, third time I have been there and everything was very good, I will say the service is kind of slow due to not enough servers but it was a Thursday night so I will cut them some slack for not being busy and only having one server , but if it was a Friday or Saturday night I would not have been very happy to wait as long as we did for our meals, but everything was very good and will be back,",1
"I went to Fez with my family and we were pretty excited to eat some good Moroccon food! However, it was a horrible experience.
1) food was below average.
2) overpriced for very small portions
3) slow service
4) I was surprised for the price they didn't even serve  free pita/ appetizer or Moroccan tea/coffee 


 The only good thing was the ambience and that's it! 
Wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't go back!",-1
"Had a great meal. Sat in the bar. About half way through the meal, someone in the kitchen turned on VERY LOUD RAP MUSIC.  Sorry , but it was extremely irritating hearing loud rap music and the music in the restaurant. REALLY? Do you have to have this music while cooking. Your not at home. You are at a business. I was it the Greenwood/ county line store",-1
The environment/ambiance were great but the host/ seating situation was awful! We had to explain to the hostess how to split our group and offered to split into groups or 2 to speed it up. The hostess said it wasn't necessary then sat 3 two tops that arrived much later than us. Thankfully after our hour wait and having our server Montez gave great service. The portion for some of the dishes were small for the price but I'd stop by again For a weekday brunch,-1
I will never eat there again. I ordered chicken Parmesan and after about four bites I realized my chicken was raw!  The manager Gary  said this hardly ever happens. What? Like it was a common occurrence. This place will never last. I ignored a good friends advice saying he had a bad meal there. Next time I will listen.,-1
"The food was ok, but the service was disorganized. No waitress seemed to know what they were doing or which tables were theirs. It took a long time to be acknowledged  and it's a tiny place. They also weren't sure if it was breakfast or lunch. Maybe it was their first day being open.",-1
"We have often eaten at this Chili's and I've had what I thought were excellent ribs - ""fall off the bone good"".  However, yesterday we stopped for dinner there and I had a Custom Combo comprising a half rack of Chili's ""Original"" ribs and grilled salmon with sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The ribs were tough and poorly prepared, clearly not slow cooked -  and just not very flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were rather gummy - the broccoli and salmon were OK.  Service was good - we had an attentive and friendly waiter but he could not make up for a below average meal.  Not sure we will go back again.",-1
"best video store in the southwest for sure. competes for best video store EVER. seriously.

place has thousands of titles and will order almost anything you want them to. they almost always have it. want ""Best of Backyard Wrestling Banned for TV"".. tell em to get it and they will. nasty-ass porno? they got it. hong kong action films with subtitles you could never read? yep. all the current hollywood garbage too.

open til 1am everynight and that is when your dvd is due. beat that!

tuesday and wednesday are 2-for-1 and people crowd in. you can pretty much rest assured that you're gonna have do a stop-and-chat with that girl who dated that guy who is friends with that other guy. 

they raised their prices recently, but still.. fuck blockbuster or hollywood and all that other crap. Casa is a local shop for local people. we'll have no trouble here.

a big difference between casa and lots of other indy video stores is the employees aren't total jackasses. they won't try to impress you with their obscure knowledge of bettie page stag films and won't treat you like the piss boy if you didn't know that stockard channing was 34 when she starred as ""rizzo"". but they will totally be down for you if you can't find the vhs copy of Koyaanisqatsi.

i can't believe they still rock free popcorn. that's rare even in bars these days.

another feather in tucson's cap for sure.",1
"Service is slow and the food lacks any flavor whatsoever.  Plus, this is supposed to be Mexico City food and it's serving burritos and northern-style tacos.  I think not.",-1
"So here recently the staff has apparently decided to just close up shop whenever they feel like it regardless of posted business hours, sometimes 7:30, sometimes sooner.  Makes you wonder if the owner or franchisee knows that.   The place improved for awhile and now it appears to be headed down hill again",-1
"4.5 stars for Bucks County.  I lived in NYC for 8 years and it's not as good as NYC pizza but it's awfully close.  The plus to this place is they make other things equally as good.  The cheesesteaks are better than any I've ever had in NYC.

I prefer the Margherita pizza or something with meat on it.  The plain cheese pizza well done is what we usually get.  I think they deliver on weekends as well.

The price is right on this pizza as well.  

The people who work their are pretty friendly and they generally offer some garlic knots.",1
"This place used to be fantastic! But since the smoking ban, the management is acting scared. Perhaps it is a necessary business model to charge for an extra clean plate upon which to share our items with eachother, but it feels greedy. The food is great. The drinks are great. The service is hit and miss.  We have had some great servers who are attentive, happy, kind, helpful. But we have had some who seem to be too busy hanging out in the bar to be attentive to the dining room. I would give this place 5 stars if not for the poor service at times, and the charge for an extra plate. So if you dont mind some of the servers who seems like they dont care about your needs, and if you dont mind paying a couple of bucks to use an extra plate, then you might like this place.  We have been going for decades, but not so much now that the service is lacking, and the greed(fear) has set in.",1
"I work very near Finnegan's at the DoubleTree near the airport. I used to go in all the time. Recently I found that they shrunk their menu. I'm ok with that because I understand the economy and the need to shave off extra meals that don't sell well. Apparently, this included any burger other than the ""burger"". They have toppings for it, however without being mentioned on the menu, you'd never know it. I used to love their hawaiian burger and mushroom burger. GREAT... I mean GREAT burgers. I still can't ding them on the food itself. Everything else on my last visit was a trainwreck. I ate with co-workers. One asked for sweetener for her tea. It didn't arrive. She asked again, and it didn't arrive. She asked a third time, and out of spite the server Andrew shoved 2 entire containers full of sweeteners. Like she needed 2 of them. One would suffice and they were slammed down in front of her as if to teach her a lesson. The management has changed, the servers are no longer any good and the service never even tried to make up for it.",-1
"food was ok but it took them 30 mins to plate our food. then they gave us a lame excuse of needing to redo one plate. mean while 3 tables after us where served the same dish. where i come from that ain't right. The only reason they received 2 stars is after mentioning the time it took, they gave us a discount, the reality is the food is just so so. plenty of other places around with better food.",-1
"Great, friendly Service.  Fun, mirthful sales lady.  Would happily buy from her if I were shopping.

I went here just to check out the correct color of a supposedly blue Citizen Eco-Drive watch.  I'm fond of this watch line in part because the styles are really quite nice for many of them, but also because of their limited environmental footprint (no battery replacement) and the potential for watches that could last me the rest of my life, not to mention the convenience of not dealing with batteries of the watch stopping.

They remembered me from the phone and had the watch that I wanted to compare to one I had purchased from ebay (that had a faded watch face compared to the one that they had).  They were friendly in comparing and also pointed out some of the other cool watches from Eco-Drive in a sales pitch that didn't feel forced and bemused me a bit.  Once I get one Eco-Drive, I should get the one for gold (with the dial on the left side so it doesn't mess with my golf swing), the Sky Hawk for when I'm a pilot, the Diving watch for diving and then I can master land, sea and air.  I felt that the saleslady felt me out for my amenability to this discussion and assessed me properly.

She then was nice in removing a link from another watch that I had and gave me the link in a plastic bag at no cost.

After I left there was no pressure or discomfort, no hard feelings and I just felt good about the whole experience.

I'd definitely shop there again.

As opposed to diamonds as I am due to learning the history of diamonds in the following articles I'd still go to this store despite it having diamonds in the name:",1
"1st time dining here was for business, at the recommendation of a co-worker. The hibachi was good, but the sushi was even better. 2nd visit was for sushi takeout, and if possible, was better than the first visit. Gave only 4 stars because I have had better hibachi (though this is good). As a sushi place, it's a 5!",1
"So meijer is amazing and so convenient! However, the starbucks is always a hit or miss and the employees don't seem to be trained right because I've noticed every time they have to pull a sheet out to see how much it is and its never the same price.. my drink wasn't good at all this morning and when i told the lady it didn't look right she poured some of my drink out and just put more milk in it to make it taste better. Wasn't really wanting to pay $4 for a cup full of milk but she didn't seem to care so why bother even saying anything.. ",1
Went on a google/yelp search.  I had been to the Italian Market a few times and did not know that it existed.  All I can say is WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?????   Ordered a couple of pounds of Broccoli Rabe sausage and 4 aged strips.  My sons were raised on top end places for steak and asked me to go back for their birthday dinners.... well I am on my way today to pick up a few large steaks for the Q.  NOT CHEAP - but as with most things in life you get what you pay for.  I will be standing in the snow cooking tonight!!!!!,1
"This place is small, actually it's tiny. But it's cool! check out the wall mural ! 

I like their business philosophy, check it out on the back of their menu. 

As for the food, Asian fusion , that's all I can tell you. 

Miso Ramen - The broth was actually decent, it's creamy and tasty. The pork shoulder falls apart with the grab of chopsticks. nicely done. 

Brisket Ramen - two big slices of Brisket, quantity over powers quality. To be honest Brisket was flavorless. This bowl contains Kimichi, kimichi with ramen how interesting.",1
"This gets two stars instead of one due to the sauce is good. The chicken was over cooked, and the fries were so hard and overcooked that they were hollow on the inside. They need to change the grease as well. I don't understand why people are calling this a great place to get wings anything else in Tucson is better.",-1
"REALLY below average food.  Akin to waffle house.  I wanted this to be good based on the reviews but not so.  The pancakes tasted like a frozen processed version, ""homemade"" maple syrup was watery/sugary with fake flavoring.  Trees make authentic syrup, not people.  The hash browns were greasy and fairly tasteless. The bacon overcooked, hard and chewy.  Obviously had been sitting awhile. Overall, very uninspired food.  Unfortunately, this is one of those places that is living on an outdated ""must go"" reputation.  There are much better offerings in Nashville.",-1
"Not worth it. There are so many great restaurants in Nashville I wouldn't waste your time here. The best party about this place is their shine-grias (moonshine, margarita, and sangria) but besides that our brunch had 9 guests and everyone's food was bland. Not to mention they messed up or checks too. Nice manager but not a spot is return to.",-1
"I have never found this market to be anything sensational except that when I need something not run of the mill like honey with the comb or something organic, I usually find it here.  They stock a lot of not seen everywhere items and the store appears very clean unlike a few in the neighborhood.",1
While I want to love 45 Tchoup because it's a Red Sox bar (WOOT!) with a good vibe and darts...the smoke in there is (in my opinion) the worst in the city. I can't breathe and I leave feeling nauseous. I've gone back a few times hoping that I can stand it but ... I can't. I think that if it wasn't for the smoke I would be there at least a few times a week during SOX season.,-1
"For a deteriorating downtown, it can be difficult to find lively & quality places to dine at. Mizu Sushi Bar, off Wash Ave., while not terrible, conforms to this sense of apathy that is killing a once bustling & eccentric area of St. Louis.

From a service perspective, we maybe saw our waitress twice throughout our meal here - once to take our order, and another to pick up the bill. The empty chairs & tables during (what should be) a very busy lunch hour added to the poor atmosphere that we experienced. We had contrastingly high hopes for the food, as we were the only people in there, so we expected more care & time put into our meals. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case: my salad floated in a pool of creamy ginger sauce, our sushi rolls fell apart at the slightest touch, and my rice was overcooked & mushy. I'll give kudos to the Mongolian Chicken - it was quite good; well fried & seasoned perfectly.

However, there are much better (and less depressing) places to find sushi in St. Louis. Spare yourself, and pass on Mizu.",-1
"No sourdough toast. They don't have hash browns (??!!). Service was not fast. Eggs are really small as evidenced by sunny side up order. That said, the food was ok.",-1
"I wish I COULD review this restaurant....  I sent 3-4 emails and called 6-7 times to try and  purchase a gift card from this restaurant.  I was contacted more than once with a promise to get back to me or that someone would be available to help - it never happened and I'm sorry to say I had to give up.  I have to believe the food is awesome based on the reviews I've read.  Customer service, not so much.",-1
"I attended a wedding there last night it was really nice. i loved the glass door entrances. It makes me wonder how long this place has been in business.  I would say it is on Par with some of the nice private event spaces on Fulton st. Service was top notch this lady Lula constantly cleared our table of half eaten cold food. The Nighttime View of the River cant be Beat!

The bathroom is a lil hard to find and it doesnt have the historical factor like the Cabildo but i would definately book  this space for a private event if there asking price wasnt astronomical.",1
"I'm sad to report that Taste of Havana left me a little disappointed. When I heard that a new Cuban place had opened in Indianapolis, I was so excited that I had my wife take me there straight from the airport. (Funny enough, she was picking me up after my trip to Miami, so Cuban food was already on my mind.)

The Fricase de Pollo (Chicken Fricassee) was just okay. It wasn't particularly flavorful, and the bed of rice it came on was soggy. 

We also ordered a beef pastelito, but got chicken. And while that's obviously not a terrible mistake, the pastelito itself was pretty bad. Much too sweet, and not in a good way. It was a little like those cheap danishes that someone brought to your office a few days ago, and that have just been sitting around since then. 

The cafecito that came with our meal was a nice touch, but ultimately, this also left us pining for Miami. The foamy top was exceptional, and it was beautifully presented in a shot glass that allowed us to watch the foam settle out. But it just didn't have the richness that we were expecting. 

It should also be said that the place was cute and the prices were reasonable. We particularly liked the crocodile-themed wall painting over the front door. 

Underwhelming on a number of levels, and nowhere equal to the hype. 

The Cuban place on Moller and 38th is far superior.",-1
"I had been to the original Melrose quite a few times against my better judgement. I was in the mood for a burger, so I got on yelp and searched. I was reminded of this location of M.L.Rose. 

There were more people there on a Sunday night then I thought there would be. It's 21+ after 5, but as far as I could tell you smoking is only allowed outside on the covered patio. You're allowed to sit where you please, so we chose a nice booth. The menu isn't big, but there's plenty of standard bar foods. Wings, nachos, burgers, and fried yumminess. We started with the triple dip which is chips with salsa, guacamole, and queso. The dips were great, but the chips were greasy or cheat. I had the five alarm burger which was supposed to be hot, but was really quite tame. I thought the pie tin of burger and yummy waffle fries was small for $11. The burger was yummy, just dry and small and not hot. My dining companion had the sweet tea chicken sandwich with waffle fries, which she said was good. 

Service was odd. At the beginning of our meal out server was great and attentive. After getting our meals she kind of disappeared. 3 of our 4 drink glasses were empty for a while until we were able to flag her down to ask for more. A few minutes later another server brought them. Our server came by once more to pick up what was left of our food but left before we could ask for our checks. We were just there too long. 

There were a few TVs where we were sitting, but none of them were big. I saw corn hole outside. I heard skee ball behind me, which I would play next time I was there. I'm sure there's also darts and I just didn't see them. I believe they have trivia one night and 2 4 1 burgers one night. 

I would be back and probably try another burger. Great addition to the area, made better with all of the parking available.",1
"Good menu, solid ingredients, but these folks are not sandwich artists.  I had a Turkey and Brie Wrap one day and the Spinach Florentine Wrap the next.  Both ""wraps"" could have more fittingly been called ""crumples"" because that's how they were assembled.  While watching the sandwich line I kept thinking, ""Thank god they're not trying to fold burritos!""  Everyone in the sandwich line either looked befuddled by anything other than a plain bagel or like they were supposed to be somewhere else ten minutes ago.  Also, can we please hang a few signs like ""order here"", ""pick-up here,"" ""pay-here"" to direct traffic instead of the east coast ""If you don already know, then leave!"" attitude?",-1
"After seeing all the others, I just had to ""chime in"" with some of my own unique criticisms.  Now there must be something really difficult about running a media delivery company that none of us can fathom.  OK, top Comcast peeves, I actually came up with eleven.  Take that Letterman!

11. Any time you call, day or night, you get the ""We are experiencing high call volumes"" message which really means ""we don't give a sh*t about your business enough to hire more staff.""
10. Labyrinthine voice mail menu
9. Internet service that regularly intermittently cuts out (this really sucks if you are using a VPN)
8. Cable stations that pixelize, especially on-demand (hey, I'm paying for that!)
7. Clueless, jaded customer service that indicates Comcast abuses its staff as much as they do you.
6. Being put on hold, transferred, dropped, repeatedly asked for security info
5. That you have to rent a modem from them or go to Target to buy one
4. They can only email your bill to your ""comcast email"" that you never use and do not need.
3. They trick you into installing their useless desktop app during initial setup
2. Controls that easily let your kid run up your bill -- ON by default of course, and the nice man that sets up your remote so nicely says nothing about it
1. Your bill is derived from a spin of the Wheel-of-Fortune

Your order may vary, but I stand by these last 2.",1
I absolutely loved this place when i first started and still do but won't be going back.  They did not honor something they told me they would. I won't go into much detail as they know the problem. I don't know what happened in the last few months but it is completely gone down fast. They are unorganized and all over the place. They got rid of their best trainers. They don't seem to be very loyal to their older clients that have been there since day 1.,-1
"My experience at Dinardo's was not a good one.  My husband had a Groupon and we went with another couple for a nice night out.  When I walked in, the place was dated and dingy.  My husband called ahead of time to make reservations and to order jumbo or large crabs, whichever they had that night.  He was told he could get 3 jumbo's and 5 large which was fine.  When they came out they were so small.   The 3 ""jumbo"" were in garlic and it was too overpowering!!  The old bay ""large"" crabs were dry inside.  The hostess tried to share her ""knowledge"" on how all crabs are #1 and they are weighed and that's how they determine large and jumbo crabs.  We just laughed and listened.  She had no idea about crabs.  We all crabbed and ate crabs since we were little children.  Grew up with them and know the difference.  My friend and I got the jumbo lump crab cake with mushy broccoli.  The cake was ok but it wasn't worth the price.  In all it was a lousy dinner and when the bill came we were lost for words.  Small crabs, a crab nacho appetizer that I believe they just waved the crab over it, since there were a few pieces here and there and crab cakes that were lukewarm.  It was a hugely disappointing dinner experience, however, the company was good and we made the best of it.  Save your money and pass on this poor excuse for a seafood restaurant!!",-1
"We had to use this main post office to get passports and although they get really busy, the passport guys at this location are a class act.

So, the passport office here opens at 8:30am and it's the only post office in Tampa that you can walk in for passports. I had to get my children passports and it was about time for me and HubbyStanks to renew. Since the only appointment we could get closer to home was during a school day we decided to walk in. The gentleman who I spoke to on the phone about the walk in was nice enough to let me know about arriving before it opens if I want to get things done without the longest wait. 

We got there at 8:15 and already there were people waiting outside with numbers. How nice that a postal worker came out and passed out numbers to the early birds. When it opened we were number 29! Although there were only 2 lines working at a time, the men behind the desk would give a person paperwork if they didn't already have it filled out, call the next number, then ask if the last number was ready. Wow! You won't find that at the DMV or any other government office. 

Another gentleman came from the back to ask if there were any renewals and since HubbyStanks and I were renewing he took care of our paperwork without us having to wait for our number. We then sat back down with our kids. When it was our kids turn our postal guy, who was retired navy, was so cool, cheerful and friendly. He made us smile and we even talked about different Naval bases that we lived.

HubbyStanks realized he needed to expedite his passport so we went into the main post office to retrieve our mail and make the change. Everyone was so helpful in allowing us to change our mind and make the changes! 

If you need to walk into a post office or even book an appointment I highly recommend using the main post office. They really have it together here. They make a somewhat painful experience a lot less painful with their awesome customer service.",1
"I went in on Friday and made a reservation for Sunday at 530 for a group of eight.  We had a show to attend at 7pm at the Fox.  Penca is a small restaurant and I knew we would not be able to walk in and get a table, hence the reservation.
We showed up and we were told it would be a while, a group was seated at our table.  We waited, and waited.  I had some disagreeable word with the hostess.  We waited some more.  We got two stories - one was none at all just ""sorry"", the other was the group came in claimed the table and told the staff they were friends of the owner and they'd cause trouble if removed from the table.  Doesn't matter to me because if the latter is true the owner needs new friends since the current ones will put them out of business, and if the former is just ineptness on the part of staff they'll be out of business.  
And so we waited some more.  Given the timing leaving for anything but Subway was not an option. We got seated about 35 minutes late.
They comp'd us two drinks for eight people for the wait.
I will give a shout out to our server who did a great job of trying to put this train wreck back on the tracks. He did a very good job.",-1
"Nice little quaint spot. Customer service was on point but the food is another story. My wife and I figured we would try the boiled calamari which also comes chilled. Not a very good choice nor taste was but the lemon vinaigrette was very good. My suggestion think twice b4 ordering it. 
  I ordered spaghetti with meat sauce now what I got was basically a bowl of sugar with a side of spaghetti. I'm not one for adding sugar to my sauce but I do know others do but this sauce was overly sweet. 
  We also ordered the bowtie pasta with salmon you could barely are the salmon and it tasted overly fishy. 
  Now, I have to say maybe other items on the menu beat these 3 dishes but I know for sure we would never order that again if we do decide to give it a second chance.",-1
"I got the chicken pad Thai to go right before closing. This is so good. I asked for soy sauce to go. The nice woman told me ""you don't need it, don't do that to yourself."" Aye, she knows WAY better than me about this here food and she is correct. I asked for limes and it only enhances these flavors. My mother in law loves this place and now I can see why. Can't wait to try the pineapple rice situation next time.",1
"The service was the most outstanding part of our visit. The pizza, however, was a bit mediocre. We ended up paying $55 for 12"" deep dish, one beer and 2 glasses of sangria (including an 18% tip.) It didn't feel like a fair trade once we left the building. I ordered ground beef and green peppers on my half and was left wishing I had also ordered cheese, as there was barely an ounce of it on the pie. If you're prepared to drop half a bill on pizza, make sure your expectations are proportionately average.",1
"I was staying downtown for work, and I needed to grab lunch before a meeting.  I walked into Sun Diner, a pretty new spot at the time, because there aren't a ton of restaurants downtown with awesome reviews.  This one looked intriguing, and I love breakfast food any time of day.  I loved the decor and layout!  Really fitting for Music City, delightfully retro.  Most of the seating is at the counter, which is casual and laid back.  

The food was pretty good.  I had a breakfast burrito.  The potatoes surprised me because there were sweet ones in the mix, not bad.  I got the wrong tea from my server at first, but it was corrected pretty easily.  Prices are on par for downtown, touristy Nashville.  Steep but expected.

My one complaint is that I had to pay at the register, which is located by the door, and there just isn't much space there if there's a line.  I kept bumping into people entering the restaurant while I waited.

Overall, I'd say this is a safe bet when you're downtown, and I think it would taste even better at 3am.  After all, it's a 24-hour diner!",1
First time here and I had high expectations for this place with the high ratings. I was disappointed with my tacos and salsa. I love green spicy salsa and this place green salsa and avocado salsa was NOT spicy at all. I also love tacos de lengua and this place tacos de lengua had no flavor at all and they only give you one tortia per taco. They say hand made tortias and I was not able to tell since nothing had flavor. Wouldn't go back.,-1
"Cannot vouch for the doctor, as the receptionist was so breathtakingly rude that I didn't even schedule an appointment. They might want to rethink their desk staff if they want to appear welcoming and friendly.",-1
Love the Greek salad. Pizza is above average. Service ranges from okay to worst on the face of the planet.,1
As a property manger I have used Alpine consistently for the last 4 almost 5 years for my re-keys and lock outs.  The quality and  continuity of their service is unparalleled.  I probably should admit this but after locking my keys in my car at a showing at the back of Cold Springs....on a Friday late in the afternoon the guys at Alpine came to my rescue.  I cant imagine using another locksmith.  They are great with my clients and exhibit professionalism beyond compare at evictions.  They are  my go to and will remain such for years to come.,1
"Got there right when it opened. Phone was fixed in less than an hour. I hope I don't need to use them again but if I do, then I know my phone will get fixed.",1
"The Pros; beautiful view. Decent food
The Cons; waited over 30 minutes for a table while tables, yes plural as many as 6 at one point, sat empty. Multiple complaints to the hostess had no positive result. 
One more pro: great waitress named Megan got us fed and kept our drinks full, eventually.",-1
"We stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered a classic and the Depot burger, we asked specifically that they be rare, the classic came in closer to medium, and Depot burger had no pink at all, why is it so hard to make a rare burger. Any way the food was good, the grilled onions we're awesome. Our waitress was great and the over cook burger was removed from our bill with an apology. Talk about being a stand up place, we will go again and most likely recommend.",1
"Ok,  my initial disappointment has been  somewhat eliviated, but the Opryland Resort is still lacking a world-class resort feel.  Perhaps it's the purpose and theme of the hotel.  There are some really nice amenities,  especially the shopping. 

The restaurants are somewhat disappointing.  Although many choices,  it kind of feels like different versions of the same choices.  Pricing is a premium,  but food is not. 

Finally,  I still don't think the resort understands what is necessary to be world-class.  It's not the property,  rooms,  or even the pricing.  It's the lack of that special sense of being taken care of.   

As a Marriott/SPG property, benchmark the Phoenician, Camelback  Inn or Desert Ridge in Scottsdale to see how it should be done.",-1
I'm at the hotel now. Finally got up to my room after they refused to let me check in 20 min early (but I saw them letting others check in). Let's not forget to mention I paid $400+ for one night here. The room is absolutely disgusting. There are stains everywhere. There is a loud ringing noise that I can't figure out what it is or where it's coming from. I'm absolutely disgusting by this place.,-1
"To be honest, I was kind of disappointed with this place. I really wanted to like it, and it has gotten so many positive reviews, so I thought it was a sure thing, but it was just a little underwhelming. Not bad, just not amazing. I had the costanza, and the fillings were tasty, but the crust was disappointing. It was way too bread-y, as opposed to doughy, and when I think of a calzone, I think of dough like pizza dough- this was not that. The calzones are a good size, but they were a little skimpy with the meat fillings. Probably the most disappointing part was the dessert- we got the apple pie calzone, and it just had a really weird spice to it- something other than cinnamon that I couldn't put my finger on. It also didn't have that many chunks of apples inside- it was almost pureed apple. Meh. 

I like the vibe of this place and it's close and convenient to where i live, so I really want to like it, but I just wasn't thrilled with it the first time. Perhaps I'll give it one more shot, but it seems a little overhyped!",-1
"This is a great independent auto shop--I have been going here about 4 years. They service all types of cars, and are very honest and knowledgeable. I had an issue with a warrantied battery replacement, and it turned out that I owed a portion of the battery costs after they submitted the claim. They didn't call me and tell me that I owed them the money. They just noted it on my file until the next time I came in for service, which wasn't until months later--they didn't have to wait like that, but they did without me even asking.  The shop is super clean, the owners are super nice, and they always have Corvettes, Vipers, Lotus, Jaguars, classic cars, or some other expensive car that they are working on or selling.",1
We stopped by to check out the hoopla around this restaurant. Given it was a Friday evening the restaurant was overflowing with people and the estimated wait time to get in was about an hours. We were about to walk away when someone said just order over the phone and pick up and that's exactly what we did and picked up the food in about 20 minutes. We ordered seafood and chicken po-boys and a bowl of seafood gumbo. The food was good but overall very very salty and the gumbo was the size of a cup and overpriced ($7.95). The woman who took my order was very friendly and helpful and we will recommend them to others.,1
"4.5, great experience 

I ordered the princess breakfast sandwich with a poached egg and a Bloody Mary. 

The Bloody Mary was lovely. Spicy and peppery, just how I like it. 

My sandwich was incredible. I ordered it with a poached egg. The egg was completely overdone so I asked them to bring me a new egg. They apologized and said they would, and I thought that was the end of it. They brought me a new egg AND an order of their bonuts. Unexpected but great customer service. I don't love sweets but I had one (my boyfriend gratefully inhaled the rest of them!) but I had one and it was very tasty. But good customer service goes a really long way, especially over such a small issue! 

The hot chicken was delicious! Would come here every weekend if I lived there.",1
"Had a real nice experience today.  Brought my 83 year old dad in who is having trouble shaving, so I thought we would try bringing him to a barber.  We were not disappointed.  This place is very comfortable, not real expensive, and actually have REAL BARBERS!  Imagine that!  You know, the kind that actually know how to cut hair properly and actually make you glad you're in a barber shop?  Well, sat my Dad down exactly on time with Les (be sure to call for an appt - they're way too popular to be able to take walkins) Les treated dad with the greatest care and before long he looked 10 years younger!   Hooray!  ALL IS RIGHT WITH THE WORLD!",1
I have gone here now a few times and have been overall very happy with my hair cuts... I have a very short pixie cut that was started by my usual hair dresser. Unfortunately she moved to a different state and it has been so difficult finding another stylist like her. I have gone to so many different salons and have paid more money than I normally would just to find someone who can cut my hair the way I want it. Well I happened to stop here one day just because I needed my hair cut and had no other ideas. It turned out great!! I was so happy to finally have my hair cut correctly! Melanie and Shelly have both done my hair and I'm very happy with how both of them have done my hair. I haven't tried anyone else at this salon but it seems like everyone is very happy with their hair cuts. The price is great and the stylists are friendly,1
"Beer Garden Review If you are looking for a casual evening with some beer and your basic pizza and fries this is it! The pizza has better crust than lariele! They have created a great cozy outdoor environment in the beer garden. I just wish they had more draft beers and more pizza options but hopefully those are coming. The service was not great, waitress seemed annoyed and took a while to come back to table. The arancini was eh. You are served with plastic plates and forks so definitely a casual setting!",1
"Yesterday was the 2nd time I have ate there, both times late in the day. Yesterday I was on a ride and saw it, stopped in for food and to warm up. Chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes. Real potatoes. Gravy was ok, steak was just fine. Salad before was ok, tough to make a bad salad. Slice of pineapple upside down cake. All was a great meal. 3 sugar coffee, most places are 2 sugar for me. Waitress was wonderful(wonder if she's single? Lol). Prices were very good.  Nice place in the middle of almost no where(I live in largo) and you can tell they have quite a few regulars.",1
"Stopped in here for dessert tonight after reading great reviews. I would have given it 4 stars except our experience dropped a star off. 
We arrived just after 9pm and closing time is 11pm so plenty of time remaining open. The only thing was that the staff were already packing up and cleaning floors, equipment ect... 
I queried closing time as thought maybe times wrong online but he said no it's 11pm! 
I just found it uncomfortable sitting and eating whilst they clean and pack up although have 2 hours work remaining!?! 
Saying all that the ice cream was really good and a great range of flavours. The ice cream was tasty and generous servings were good although at nearly $5 for 2 scoops it's a little bit expensive.",1
I wanted to like Izumi but didn't. The host/waiter certainly was accommodating so service was not the issue. For the price I found the portion size to be very small.  When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.  As someone who lived in Japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven I was underwhelmed by izumi.,-1
"We bought/rented some kegs from BevMo for our wedding and overall, our experience was good.

We decided to go with BevMo because of their selection and prices.  We ordered two 7 gallon kegs of ""local"" beer (Oak Creek), and when we went to pick them up, one of them was labeled wrong which caused a lot of distress because we didn't realize it until we'd gotten to our venue an hour and a half away.  However once it was tapped we realized it was the correct beer.

We also rented taps and tubs to keep the kegs cold- it was nice to be able to get all of those items in one place and have people help us load it in our truck.

After our wedding we returned the items and the deposit was refunded on our card in a heartbeat.  Easy and fast, we'd totally do it again!",1
"Moving and storing possessions important to you is a stressful process. I have found that Nicole is consistently professional, polite and helpful. This is a very busy business so sometimes there is a wait. What I've noticed is that both Nicole and Stacey take their time to make sure the paperwork is complete and that customers understand everything. If you have a short wait, just know that when it's your turn, they will give you the same undivided attention. Nicole has really helped me during a very stressful time. I really appreciate that.",1
Ordered veggie bowl that was delicious.  One thing is I left still hungry. I think the portion is overpriced  ($14). I'll probably never come back again considering I left hungry after waiting 45 minutes. The people are chill and I appreciate the family presence here. I happened to be sitting at the bar next to the owner. The bar tender is her son. He was really nice.,-1
"Looking for good Greek food in StL?  This place gets my seal of approval.  

Momo's is the equivalent of greek tapas, which means that some of the more popular traditional dishes won't exist here.  But in Greece they are called mezes, also meaning small plates and basically served the same way Spanish tapas are.  And to be honest, I think the Greeks had them well before the Spanish, so it isn't a ""everyone is doing tapas"" now thing, it is actually fairly traditional to several European/Mediterranean cultures, so keep your pants on people...

Food: I really like the mezes here. I like to start off with a spread, and after trying the Melitzanosalata last time we were in I am going to recommend it!  Although, I feel that we never get enough pita when we are here, so ask for more early. Service review comes later.  And also a cheese plate.  I prefer the baked feta, but last time we got the brie, which was also really good, though it is covered with sweetness (fruits and a sweet sauce) so I am going to leave it for my ""dessert"" choice next time, GREAT way to finish a meal.  You can also get your fill of spanikopita, saganaki, dolmades, and other greek staples that you may not be so familiar with like the Grilled Lokaneko Sausage.  So good.  I was part of a plan to try to make these sausages once, and after a successful batch I have decided it is really just easier for me to go find a good one someone else made...

Not a fan of or just not in the mood for mezes?  You can also get your hands on a good gyro.  Not the best gyro in town, for that you would have needed to head back down Delmar to the Gyro House with cash in hand - but I am not sure of the status of this place, well that's another review... In the mean time, swing in here for a decent piece of gyro.

Service: Ok, this is super spotty.  Sometimes I go in and I get awesome service, quick seating,  easy ordering, great drinks (I like the Sangria, I know, not Greek, but the make it so good). Other times, like this past time, I decide to order all of my mezes at once because I worry I will absolutely never see my waiter again.  And I consider running out on the check because after I haven't seen him since he set down the food I wonder if he was killed by a belly dancer.  Ok Momos, I have never run out on a check here, but really get it together.  We seem to have great service sitting inside and poorer service sitting outside. Isn't the patio the coveted spot? I just want to see my waiter more than three times during a meal: drinks, order, food drop off.... yeah you should at least see him one more time for the check!  It can be a bit of a catastrophe.

Atmosphere:  Not gonna lie folks, the belly dancers freak me out.  I prefer to go on non-dancing nights (aka Sunday) and before they get into full swing.  It is entertaining at first, then it gets creepy.  Some people love it, like all the tipsy 40 and 50 year old guys, and actually some of the ladies night out crowds too... this is beyond my comprehension.  But if this is your thing, get in there.  I am fairly sure these girls are good at what they are doing, some are obviously better than others, but they can shake it (which is why I think the outdoor service is bad, they only dance inside).  Also the decor is cool.  Nothing to write home about, but it feels like a Greek place to me with warm bold colors and lanterns.

Overall: I am going back.  It is right by my house, it is a great little spot, and I like the meatballs (I don't think I mentioned that before).  The food is great! The service sometimes sucks, but you cant get it all all of the time.  So try it out! and ask for extra pita.",1
"We stayed a night for a ""special occasion"" over the weekend. We were able to walk from our canal-side apt, mostly because we didn't want to pay the $28 garage fee. There are plenty of valets out front, someone to open the doors for you and any check in agents not busy at their station wait in front of the counter to greet you and bring you to their station.  Check in was easy and quick and the agent was very kind. After answering all my questions about check out times, restaurant hours, and fitness center and pool locations, she took me directly to the elevators. She proudly stated that there were 2 sets of elevators, with the high rise lifts being the ""fastest in the midwest"".  Between the concierge and elevators is the Lobby Lounge with a couple tall fire n ice type fireplaces and lots of comfy looking couches, tables, and bar tables. The lounge menu looks interesting and they even have a Soju cocktail! (that's a Korean rice liquor drink.) Specialty cocktails are $9.
We had requested a high level room and we got the 28th (out of 33) floor with a big picture window view over the end of the canal and the White River. We had a standard double bed with oh so comfy bed linens, a work desk with a cordless phone, flat screen Samsung TV and coffee maker. The shower had a large glass door and a rain type shower head as well as 2 smaller adjustable heads below it. Fun but you can't turn all the heads on at the same time.  We were very nicely greeted with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries after we returned from dinner, which we finished off in our bathrobes.  There is an iPod docking stereo which we couldn't get to work, but we could hear directly from the iPhone pretty well anyway. 
The hotel and rooms are clean with a Vegas like feel. We looked around the fitness center, which is quite large and has lots of machine and small semiprivate areas for yoga/pilates/bosu. The indoor pool looked pretty small. Our room came with free breakfast at Osteria Pronto which has a sizable buffet for only $16. It would be a very nice stay in Indy for out of towners and I'd return to the bar and restaurant as a local.  I actually like the look of the building and think it makes downtown look more modern. Great location close to museums, connected to the convention center, and close to the mall and canal.",1
"It was your average target experience.  The staff at this target were very nice.  Most of the staff I ran into greeted me with a smile and a ""Do you need help?"".  

Store was clean and organized.  Parking was easy.

I gave it 4 stars because the water selection was almost completely gone.  Shelves were nearly empty and selection was sorely lacking.",1
"Usually have great experiences at PP, but with their new (nice) facility it seems like they've got a couple of new rude employees to go with it. The others were great as usual...some people don't belong in healthcare, I guess. I might still come here, but they won't be getting donations from me anymore. Large parking lot is awesome, though.",-1
"I have to write an update because I've been hearing some really nasty things about the diner part of this restaurant. I keep hearing that they've gotten super slow and that the food is gross. I I went here yesterday and it was Lightning Fast service. My salad was delicious , I got a bread basket and tons of food. Everything was out faster than I even think McDonald's could bring food out. It was not expensive. Sure I can think of plenty of better restaurants but this is a diner and I can't think of any diners in the area that are better than this",1
"We stopped at Tako due to the positive reviews on yelp. We brought a bottle of white wine with us, the staff did not bring a ice or a chill bucket for us. It took 45 minutes for our appetizers to come out. The edamame was over cooked and mushy while the spring roll did not look appetizing almost like it was frozen. I could buy better spring rolls from trader joes.
Next we moved on to our sushi which was sat on the sushi bar for 15 minutes before it was brought to us. The sushi it self was good, but not the best I have ever had,
If I came here again I would not buy any appetizers. The service was slow",-1
"It pains me to rate anyone a single star, but I really was disappointed with my meal at Market Grill last night and won't be back.  

We, a three-some, went on the recommendation of an acquaintance.  First impression walking in the door, smoke-free (yay!) and beautiful original brickwork, but a really scrubbed-clean feeling.  Which is good, or could be.  Maybe it just felt out of place in Soulard 

From there it was all downhill.  The menus we were given were dog-eared, ripped, with pen marks and spots of indeterminable provenance.  Poor impression.  Print some new menus.  

We were not offered a drink list.  When I asked for the drink list, the server said, ""We don't have a drink list, but I can get you a wine menu.""  But there is a neon Bud Light sign in the window.  If you don't have a list printed, use your voice and tell me what you offer.  A note on the wine menu: sorted into reds and whites.  Fair enough.  Beneath the reds?  The whites.  And beneath the whites?  The reds.  Print some new menus.  And considering the venue, their wine pricing is high.  The server made no effort to sell us drinks.  

The food.  The first thing the server told us was that they were out of the soup of the day.  Ok, fine, benefit of the doubt, it must have been excellent and super-popular, right?  We started with hummus - not my choice.  Did not meet expectations.  I ordered meatloaf.  It was surprisingly dense and rather dry - full of filler.  The mashed potatoes looked more like mashed hash browns, I don't quite know how to describe them.  The green beans had to have come from a freezer bag.  And the fried onion & jalapeno straws were completely out of place on the plate.  I probably left half of my food behind; I could have done better at home.  

One of my friends ordered a wrap he seemed to enjoy, the other ordered the special - they serve prime rib Saturday evenings.  She found it under-done but it looked right to me.  For some reason we thought we might need an order of the mac and cheese.  Friends, if your mother ever made you mac and cheese, this will be a disappointment.  

My glass of wine was empty for, I don't know, a good half an hour.  The server never noticed.  

The facilities in the handicap bathroom I realize must have been built to code but anyone paying attention will notice that the soap dispenser, mirror, and towel dispenser are unsuitably high for someone sitting in a wheelchair.  

I wish Market Grill all the best; someone has put a lot of love into the building and is trying to make it as an entrepreneur, and I appreciate that.  But they need some serious focus and refinement on the menu concept and design and a reboot on the service.",-1

"the customer service and quality of nails here is impressive. I called and made an appointment for 6:30PM (at 6PM). The women on the phone said no problem. I show up and the place was packed, but the women said I had an appointment and took me right away.  I was glad I made an appointment. She was quick and my nails look great! I got a no chip manicure. Place is clean and have a wide variety of colors to choose from.",1

"IF YOU ARE ON A STUDENT BUDGET, READ ON:

This is a 5 mile wide/long convention center. It has up to 2,000 guestrooms.  The conference I went to had 6,000 attendants. Of course I booked late and I didn't want to spend $200+/night on these hotel rooms! Otherwise this place is ginormous. The service (shuttle), lunch/drinks were really well done.  This place is immaculate; I do not know how many workers they staff.  

The food of course is overpriced (I had lunch/dinner at Wasabi. My bento box was $25.  Overpriced right?)  I also had lunch at the pizza place Paisano (forgot the name).   

If you decide to stay at the hotels across the street from the convention center (it is only 1 mile away - across from the McGovick Pwky).  They have Cracker Barrel, Apple Bees, Chillis?, McDonalds there.  The hotel I stayed in (being on a student budget) was crappy but I can't complain for $55/night.  It was Days Inn. It was walkable to shuttle pick up stop at Marriott Hotel (walk ~0.3 miles).  

They have Finleys pub, FUSE (night/club), STAX burger, Jack Daniels and more restaurants inside this convention center.  

I posted some photos.",1
Sooooo good!!! I prefer to take out and I have never actually picked up myself so I have no idea besides what I am told on how the dining experience is... Basically very Bosnian /Bosnian people in the restaurant... But who doesn't like diversity? And that's all I was told also I heard its pretty clean! Cheers to this place for making awesome gyros!,1
"I had the most disappointing and appalling experiencing ordering catering from this specific Chick-fil-A location. When I voiced my frustration with the Manager on Duty, I was made to feel like my problem was of no concern or care to her and her team and she was unwilling to de-escalate my frustrating situation. She was much more interested in being right than doing what she could to help me as the customer of a large order. I would NOT recommend ordering catering from this location unless you have the time and flexibility to take a chance on a tight schedule getting disrupted for the group you are feeding.",-1
"I went to the salon for a hair cut and Meghan was my stylist. She did an ABSOLUTELY amazing job and was full of personality. I got a wash, cut, and blow out all for $27 bucks because it was my first time! I also got a coupon to come back for 20% off anything I have done in the salon which I will be redeeming later this month. I am very excited to find a great salon that is near my house & doesn't cost a million dollars to get something done. 

I have been here for the Benefit Brow Bar as well which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you want your brows to look amazing - it is the best place you can go . I trust them with my life. 

I really can't say anything negative about Ulta. I am surprised at the ""rude customer service"" complaint because I have only experienced the best here. (plus there is always a coupon so I really REALLY love this place).

OK bye!",1
"99% of the time I love Whole Foods. This week and last week, though, I am quite disappointed. We drive a distance to come to shop here so we always eat from the salad bar. Two weeks in a row, there is no vegan salad dressing available. They usually have 4 vegan options. Last week I didn't discover that they were out until after I had made my salad. When I asked about it, the gentleman said ""we're out til Monday. "" He didn't seem concerned or offer any alternatives so I gave him my salad and left.  This week, still no salad dressing, but I looked before I made my salad, and I purchased my own vegan dressing. Come on Whole Foods. Please don't disappoint me again.",-1
"MY review is based on the sales department. The service department is AMAZING and are not relevant to this score. Also, Richard (aka Michael) at Ray Brandt was AMAZING. Great guy and made my test-driving experience one of the best! Unfortunate that the lease deal (that was not in his control) was nowhere close to honest or accurate.


BACKSTORY: Returning a VW Jetta lease just days before my lease is up. Went to Ray Brandt first (and did not just deal with one person, I dealt with 3+ not including Richard) because I initially leased from them and ended up running for the door. Called Southpoint VW immediately after and I have no words for how awesome they were. I'm just going to explain the difference between Southpoint VW and Ray Brandt VW:

RAY BRANDT: I am not in this ""90 day period"" to return my car so they will have to do me a PERSONAL favor and take the hit of my return fee and minor scratches (that added up to $1,300 btw). Meaning it was no longer an incentive for me to return my car, it was a personal favor I should be thankful for.  THEN on my quote print out.. there re-appears the $1,300! They snuck it back in my price thinking I would not notice and tried to cover up with some story about taking it out of my ""discount"" (but I followed what they were saying, and it indeed was a deception)

SOUTPOINT: No such thing as ""90 day period"".. I was leasing another VW, therefore they did not even care to inspect my car. I hand it in as is (assuming I had my 4 doors and bumper of course!). 
---------
RAY BRANDT: I wanted the black Tiguan and I had to pay $200 transportation cost to get it from another dealer

SOUTHPOINT: No only did they pick up the black Tiguan from another dealer 100 miles away, they drove it all the way from Baton Rouge to my WORK! NO CHARGE!
---------
RAY BRANDT: Expected I pay 70% of the MSRP in 36 months. WHAT?!?! and they had no explanation (except for jargon) when I asked three times for the break down and how that makes sense to THEM. 

SOUTHPOINT: Paying 35% MSRP in 36 Months. BEFORE negotiation
-------

RAY BRANDT: Any and all incentives (that I knew about beforehand) were now personal favors. Told me the price break-down print out was something they ""don't show people""!  Ok, only every other dealership I visited before showed me the print out WITHOUT that fancy line. I give my social, birthday, salary, credit history, and address... I think I more than deserve to know the details of my future car! 

SOUTHPOINT: Gave max incentives, honored all deals online, adjusted discount to make whatever I put down still in ratio with other deals for down-payment promos that I wasnt participating in, wrote off $$ on contract based on negotiated prices we had talked about. Gave me all information and price details upfront. 
---------

RAY BRANDT: Jacked the MSRP price $1,200 more than market price claiming when the car comes from Germany it's a bit lower but once it gets to dealership they add things such as ""felt trunk separator"" and the ""first aid kit"" that factors the price higher. AGAIN... WHAT?!! hah!

SOUTHPOINT: MSRP was $4,000 lower than RAY BRANDT  (SAME EXACT CAR). Mind you- it's not actually ""lower"".. this IS the price of the car. 
-------

RAY BRANDT: $467/month $1,000 down for basic factory standard Tiguan S 2016 (please look up so you can laugh that I could lease an AUDI for that much). 

SOUTHPOINT: $256/month $0 down. SAME TIGUAN S 2016!! 
-------

RAY BRANDT: Only saw me as easy $$$ and an ignorant consumer

SOUTHPOINT:  Respected me AND my wallet. They did EVERYTHING to make my experience as convenient as possible, honestly and ethically. 

--------

Even if Ray Brandt dealership gave me a deal I couldn't resist, I still wouldn't be able to sign the contract because I don't trust them.",-1

Build enough odd food combinations, treat your customers very poorly, make sure dirt is part of the ambiance, and you too can be a Milksuccess.

"This is 3 miles away from the main drag of State Street (taxi costs approx $15 to get into 'town').  Rooms are a decent size and the front desk staff were very pleasant.  Coffee, fruit, cookies and water free in the  room.  And the Cal KIng mattress was the most amazing mattress I've ever slept on to be quite frank.
We had one unfortunate incident at the restaurant attached to the hotel - 4 of us went to breakfast there this morning. We're English by birth but we've lived in Los Angeles for many years.  However, the restaurant staff heard our English accents and decided that they could take us for a ride with the tip.  When presenting us with the check, they added a 20% tip to the final total.  We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it's a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.  He informed us that many ""Europeans"" don't know the tipping ettiquette and therefore, they decided to assist us by 'adding 20%"" to the check.  His manner and demeanor was completely offensive.",-1
"Would be firm 4 star place, but the misses were plenty. 

Let's just get it out of the way, the tacos are pretty legit. I eat at the taco trucks and the down and dirty corner stores and these are pretty good. The restaurant did right by not pricing themselves out of this market. It is a tad pricey, but i think it is worth it--$3.50 per. 3 = $10.50. Mexican places hover around 3 for $8-9, so the price point isn't too far off. 

What separates and warrants the additional pricing is the finished product compared to traditional Mexican spots. Instead of just the meat being center attention, there are Buena Onda has additional garnishes that elevate a typical street food. 

I ordered:
-fried mahi mahi
-carnita
-carne

all were pretty good but the winner by a mile was the mahi mahi. I used the red hot sauce (in the jar, not bottle), so i can't review the green one. The red sauce was really nice, added more flavors to the already flavorful tacos.

Here were the misses...

1. my cousin and i ordered 4 tacos. Cashier rang up 3. 
2. we ordered 2 modelos. Cashier rang up 2 modelos AND 1 CORONA
3. we showed him the ""rewards"" program to get discount. Cashier never gave discount. 

When we paid, i was wondering why it was so high (expecting the discount) and why we got a Corona? Our order was not complex...we did not ask questions. Just put order and paid. I defended the cashier saying ""they just opened, must be oversight"". BUT, my cousin believes he was high while on the job. OH well. 

ALso, i'm not sure how their system is setup because all 3 tacos came out on one tray. What if two people share 3 tacos like i did? I had to ask for another tray, which wasn't a problem, but inconvenient considering we ordered ""separately"" but paid all together.",-1
I've been a customer for 6 years with no issues. I moved and had service installed at my new address. Apparently this is the quality of work you can expect from their technicians. As of right now I'm still waiting for a return call to find out how they plan on rectifying the issue.,1
"Converted building exceeds Embassy Suite/Hilton Standards
Located close to the airport in an area with apartment/condominiums, the property is a converted property with a Hilton/Embassy Suite Stamp so it does not have usual open atrium.  As a result, the rooms seems like they were converted from single bedroom apartments - my room was spacious with a kitchenette.  Staff from check in to the breakfast are outstanding.

Pro:
* Hilton standards, bed, linen, great breakfast
* Gym - located next to the pool, Precor equipment with two adjustable benches, dumbbells 5-50 pounds, two Ellipticals, two threadmills, multi-functional machine

Minus:
* Pay for parking, $8 self-parking and $15 valet
* Manager's Reception area is small

Would I return?  Maybe.  The convenience to the airport and MacDill AFB makes it great, but paying for parking will make me look for other properties without having to pay for parking.",1

"A downtown without a bookstore is like a downtown without... I don't know I lost the metaphor. It's just sad is what it is. You need books, you need a place to browse, talk with other book lovers, and listen to book readings. Indy Reads is that place. And it's more than that because all proceeds support a great cause, adult literacy. Most of the books are used so donate a book and pick up a new (used) one. You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for, you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them. The kids books are also arranged by color, which makes it harder for me to distinguish between titles as I glance through. Prices are excellent throughout, and the space is really nice.

"Definitely a fan of this place, Citizens Bank Park.  I like the arena itself. I am a mets and former fan of the evil empire, Yankees, so I don't know if me and most Philly fans get along.  I had the best time here though before in the two games I visited.  It was a on the whim drive here from NY to catch a sunday night baseball Nationally televised game BRAVES-PHILLIES.  Seats were a lot cheap than both citified and yankee stadium and the drive home that late at night was not that bad.

I recommend a visit here if you are in the area. Great food and great views of the field from almost any seat.  Another cool fact about this philly arena is that the other team stadium are right there, PRETTY much on the same block.  IT is like if in New York, we had madison square garden, giants stadium and citified all lined up next to each other basically a three block radius.  I thought that was pretty cool.  cHECK out Citzens Bank Park at least once, even if you have to root for the other team and hopeful avoid getting in some fistfights.",1
"I was not impressed,  too me it was more like a preppy local market for the wannabe Italians.  My family lives an hour or so North from there, so they figured it would be a treat.... Nah!  The prices on a lot of the items were an arm and a leg.... I told my folks listen... you want the stuff, I'll ship it to you.  Oh and by the way... I was checking out some items in one the of the isles, as I walked passed this women I had said ""mi scusi"" to be polite it means excuse me in Italian, what the hell I figured I was in a supposedly in an Italian market; wanted to bring some Italia to the place;  she mutters under her breath ""asshole""  

I just wanted to add one thing to this review.  The women in question was what you call an arrogant snob and I politely said to her and I quote ""It's a shame that we as Americans treat one another in such a way"" she blushed and turned away.

When you go to a ""make your own"" donut joint you go for the experience, and their clip board was not doing it for me. The amount of items on the clipboard seemed overwhelming and I was instantly confused. I was also extremely disappointed that you could only get one topping. I was really excited to let my almost two year old load up his donut as a special treat, come to find out he could only add sprinkles. The donuts were tasty, but in my opinion it isn't worth a drive. The experience just didn't do it for me.",1
"This is a great place to stay. I picked it because of the full kitchen, it was very helpful. We didn't spend as much money on food. Its very clean and cute!",1
"Plain, bland, not good sushi restaurant.  3-4 younger Chinese boys were the sushi chefs.  None of the staff was friendly or concerned about my experience.  

I had a dragon roll which was mushy, a spider roll which wasn't soft shell crab, and a spicy tuna roll that had a bunch of sesame seeds rolled into the rice.  

Normally at a sushi restaurant I would order nigiri only but the fish in the hoshizaki refrigerator at the sushi bar looked unappetizing and not properly stored.

Will not come here again. Stay away.",-1
"they started serving breakfast, and its a good deal: two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, and hashbrowns for about five bucks. not bad. the food isnt the greatest, but its reasonably priced--especially the breakfast. the burgers are mediocre and the mexican food isnt too great, but its a dependable place.",1
"I purchased Maverick beef jerky peppered and the natural one and broke my tooth really bad. I spoke with them and they suggested giving me a gift card, I thought that was ridiculous. I suggest that the damn that they call the company that makes the product and see if there was any other issues with other customers about this. I'm sure they didn't do anything about it I'll check into it as far as I'm concerned. Concerned customer",1
"Kind of a hit or miss for me. Some days I'll find tons of things that I like, the staff is friendly and willing to lend a hand, and the store is clean. Other times I'll find nothing, the store is a disaster, the staff is unpleasant and not helpful, and I leave not wanting to return. I won't stop shopping here, however, I will start making the management aware of times when my experiences with the staff are less than pleasant.",-1
"for the price this place is very good. your looking at spending the same on a sub at quiznos but at least here the ingredients taste fresher. Pastrami is very good but I do prefer it cold here. by the way, they are big enough to split, even if you are pretty hungry.",1
"I came here for chicken nachos and a cold beer, service was quick and friendly.  Nachos were hot and the beer was cold, Success!",1
"Reno has a lot of great AYCES places. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. 

Horribly let down by other reviewers who rated this place 4+ stars. Fish tastes like catfood. The kind of sushi you expect from the little teriyaki/sushi places in Sacramento. Perhaps other guests missed this because every roll has either jalapenos or hot sauce to cover up the flavor. 
If Reno has any taste at all, this place will fail within a year.  

The gyoza and miso are delicious, load up. 

Edit: I let them know it wasn't great and they only charged me for one roll. Otherwise this would be a 1-star rating.",-1
"Thank goodness someone said don't worry about the number of reviews! I just walked in today and got a hour massage (half hour chair, half hour feet) for $60. Highly recommend David!",1
"The little add-on to Delicia.  I would imagine most people come here for a drink while waiting on their table for Delicia.  They have very similar food, and nearly identical drinks (besides the signature ones like Fire N Ice) 

We ate here once before and the food was good.  Bartender is not overwhelmed and therefore very friendly and talkative.  Drinks are made well and cost about %25 less than next door at the restaurant. 

Would I come here purely for La Mulita? nope....but I'd come here while waiting for my table at Delicia for sure. ",1
looking at the reviews you would think this place is exceptional. I walked in to a super tiny hipster restaurant with staff who don't smile.... and a very tiny menu with nothing special. this place is absolutely not even close to being authentic. Food was just okay. Next time i'm hitting up a real ramen place in Chinatown.,-1
"First time turkey meal buyer. Absolutely disgusted. The turkey was raw when it was supposed to be fully cooked. Bloody n slimey and plain disgusting. Ruined Thanksgiving and can never get that day back. 
Best advice:  DO NOT BUY!!",-1
"Love the food! Been bringing the Fam here for years. Recently, the service has gotten very slow compared to years past & some of the servers have a sulky attitude...Sad. Good news is their other location is just do n the road.",-1
"If you like Mexican food, this little gem is a must.  There's nothing totally spectacular about this restaurant, they just do a lot of things right.  The service is quick, the food is reasonable and the taste is spot on.  They have outdoor dining, but don't eat there if outdoor ambiance is what you're looking for.  It's really more utilitarian than anything else.  Not much in the way of décor.  The inside of the restaurant is clean, but dated.  Nothing wrong with that.  It's not upscale, just a family restaurant that makes good food.

You really couldn't ask for more in regards to value.  The price is really low and the servings are large.  I honestly don't think you could get this much food, for this price, at Taco Bell.  And this is real authentic Mexican food, not TexMex.

I'll eat here again.",1
"Maybe I just don't like gift shops. They have some fun and quirky stuff here but nothing I would ever really want to receive as a gift, so it's nothing I would ever give as a gift either. I love supporting local businesses, but most of the time I stop in here for something I leave empty handed.",-1
"I have read the reviews of other past raters, and am sorry for their past experience.  I on the other hand have had much help and felt welcome.  I have been going to this library every day for the past year.  Why?

I am a school bus driver, from the Randolph County area.  I drive 20 minutes from my house to the bus yard, then pick up a student (Special Ed), and drive this student to a special school in the Belleville area.

Because of the low pay and long distance drive, I made arrangements with my boss, who is also the owner of the bus company, that I can stay up there, that the Library is only 2 miles from the school, and I would have plenty to keep me occupied.

Since it would also save him fuel/maintenance costs (making 1 trip as opposed to 2 trips), he allowed me to do that.  They have been good to me.  Yes sometimes it gets a little loud, and it has become a 2nd home for the less fortunate, but it has many great reference materials.

It is an old building, but I view the architecture as a work of art.  The second floor has a huge ceiling, with giant windows.  It is nice and open.  Thier reference section has shrunk down as they are re-arranging thier book set-up.

They have undergone renovations, and changed thier computer policy.  Now visitors can get 3, 30 minute sessions online.  The computer system is now linked up to all of southern IL, from Cairo to Effingham. 

If you have a library card anywhere in the southern part of the state, even if you have a Carbondale, or Mt Vernon card, it is now good for checking any book out there.  You can also access the Online Catalog system, and access your library account, and even place items on order yourself, and the staff will even show you how to do that if you ask them.

I am writing this review upon my final visits, due to, as I will be driving to a different school starting next week, in a different area of the Metro East.  They all knew what I did as a bus driver and was supportive of my being there as well.

So I have had good experiences overall, and rate the place about a 4, because it is in a building of Historical Significance, the computer access policy, an awesome microfilm (of Belleville News Democrat - Back to 1930s) collection, and a great children's section as well.",1
"I mean this in the most positive and reverent way when I say that some day at my funeral, the words that will be spoken in hushed tones by everyone, will be ,"" spicy peanut chocolate donut"".",1
"The fries were delicious. The Louisiana Spicy Beef Hot Link is a zesty, spicy hot link that they place on a plain cold bun. I actually liked the taste but it was too spicy to finish. The condiments were typical of any hot dog restaurant that you might find elsewhere for a cheaper price but you're in Santa Barbara so that's not happening.",1
"I don't eat a ton of Chinese takeout because I haunt various local Asian markets and buy and cook the stuff myself. But a small cooking accident and a burned hand lead me to order out at this South Chinese/Vietnamese place, and I was pretty satisfied with the result.

My order was hot and freshly ready in just under ten minutes; I barely had time to hit an ATM around the corner. It wasn't super cheap; I paid for two dishes what I would have paid for three at the cheapest of such places, but the portion sizes were such that I'll get 2.5-3 meals anyway, which is about right for the price. And it was respectable American Chinese cuisine, with my Kung Pao dish highlighted by a mix of vegetables and a decent amount of peanuts, and my lemongrass tofu having the option of noodles or rice with a little salad and separate sauce on the side. Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.

For some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag. If they wanted five stars from me, they could do things like improve those containers or not sneak broccoli into dishes where it isn't listed or offer non-soy vegetarian dishes for variety, but their menu now isn't bad.

Their online menu proudly proclaims that the dishes in its vegetarian section are ""prepared with vegetarian ingredients"", which sounds redundant until you realize that Chinese places can and will sneak in something that isn't. So I appreciate that notification, and will most likely order something else from that menu the next time I decide I want Chinese takeout.",1
"I have a 54 saltwater tank at home so I had to see this one. Its Big, really Big
Visited for lunch on a sunny day. The service was great and there was only a handful of patrons eating. I sat next to the fish tank and ordered fish tacos of course and a Ice tea. Spent about 40 minutes there eating and relaxing. I asked if they could accommodated me to view the nuts and bolts of the aquarium operation. They did!
Oh yeah, the food and service was great.",1
"Service stank.  Goofed up 5 orders, took us 30 min just to cash out.  Not going back!",-1
"I eat mostly vegetarian and was super psyched to go to Blue Sage at its new location - as I had tried to frequent the old location every year when I came home for the holidays.  It's still a great atmosphere and excellent wait staff, but the acoustics in the one large room off to the right when you enter are pretty terrible.  I was there with my older father, who is hard of hearing, and we had to be moved to another location so we could hear each other talk. I would recommend asking not to be in that room when making a reservation.  Also, during this most recent visit I found the food to be more bland than I remembered.",-1
"Let me say, that I don't live in Missouri and my state banned indoor smoking a long time ago.

I went to Hot Shots with friends, the menu had a variety of options.  Mostly it was basic sports bar food.  I forgot Missouri allows indoor smoking, the place smelled like an ash tray and you left smelling like one too.

Service was ok, you could almost predict when the waitress would return (about every 5 minutes).  Plenty of TV screens to watch sports, over all not stellar nor good.",1
"Group of hostesses were not welcoming when we walked In at 8:25pm, we didn't have reservations,  told us we wouldn't be able to sit until 945, I then went on open table and booked one for 8:30pm, oh isnt technology amazing! We were sat at 8:35, the group of 4 women at the front just seemed to want to  be bitchy because we didn't make reservations ahead of time, but the website clearly says walk in welcome. The waiter was nice, I had the luke burger and it was average, the bottom bun was soggy from the grease... fries were cold. However my wife had the shrimp and grits and said it was the best she has ever had.",1
"Very nice lady took my order. I stuck to my go to meal which is Crispy cashew chicken, which was a decent size but super expensive.  The cashew chicken was just ok at best. They did not make this as a combo order so I also ordered a side of egg roll. These were horrible. My husband had the pork fried rice which was decent.  He also ate their crab Rangoon that was extremely sweet. My husband also got a small order of egg drop soup which was fine. I don't think this is too much food yet it cost $25. Way too expensive for so so food.",-1
"This Taco Bell location is one of those KFC/Taco Bell combined restaurants--two menus in one restaurant.  The Taco Bell doesn't even show up on the Taco Bell restaurant locator--I checked their website afterward.

I wanted a chalupa and a Diet Coke.  And a bean burrito.  And a taco.  I was desperate, yet this is a VERY iffy neighborhood, even in the daytime.  My lilly-white ass had a rental car, so I looked around as I pulled into the drive-thru.

Seriously, just after I placed my order in the call box, a tricked out Monte Carlo with spinners blasting G-Unit pulled up behind me with four thugs and a shawty laughing and shaking their car.  And the hoopty in front of me was bumping Lil Wayne.  Aw, DAMN.  I figured the bullets wouldn't start flying until we all got fed, so I was safe for a few minutes.

Typical Taco Bell food--warm, greasy and yummy...except they forgot my bean burrito...bitches.  Would I go back?  Oh, HELL NO!",-1
"I had already reviewed the Speedway location, which I think is far better.  We stopped for a Margarita at Casa Molina Del Norte, and while good, they were pretty overpowering.  Later on we had take-out from this location, and it was woefully poor compared to the Speedway locationl.  Maybe it's because of take- out, and not eat - in.  I feel that way about Chinese food...
maybe Mexican is the same as Chinese food... not as good as eating in.",-1
"Sadly I am revoking my 5 star review of Gallagher's. I went here last night and asked for their world famous nachos. Guess what, new menu. SERIOUSLY you're going to get rid of the awesome nachos?

No more frosted beer mugs plastic cups. And they also changed the prices on pitchers. PBR now $12 instead of $9. This will not stand.

I would also like to mention the place smelled like a ""radio rock festival"" or cat urine. It looks like Gallagher's is changing for their new lame clientele and they just lost a great customer.",-1
"Ok. I've literally been going here since I was a child, with my dad, to use the batting cages. Good memories. I think of this place fondly.

Hadn't gone much in recent years, a few times. Decided to go the other day for a pretty important game to decide the teams who would play the World Series.

Place is much dumpier than I remembered it, but fine. Food was decently priced and seemed fresh enough for a dive bar. Bartender gave us good service as she had a bar full of regulars (at 3:00 pm on a Thursday afternoon) and we were the only table requiring service. 

Two things were problematic for me.

One: A loud-mouthed regular at the bar was blathering on about how he and his wife once walked down the coast in California and came across a nude, gay beach, and went on about how ""[expletive] disgusting"" it was, ad nauseum. Perhaps that isn't a problem the Home Plate can fix, I understand, having spent years in the hospitality business...you can't censor what your customers say. But I'm just mentioning it because if you bring your kids here to use the batting cages, they walk through the bar. The batting cages are in the outdoor area where bar regulars go to smoke. Where said loud-mouthed regular may be mouthing off as well. Is it a big deal? You decide.

Two: The bartender, although she was nice and gave fine service, was complaining about ""WHY is there still baseball in OCTOBER??"" Companion and I were like...you work at a place called Home Plate and are complaining about baseball in October??

There are much better sports bars in Tucson. We won't be back.",-1
"I got a craving for a turkey burger and was in the area.  It had been over half a year since my last bad experience, so I thought I'd give it another shot.  I am happy to say that I didn't regret it.  I have been back another time since then and the service has been excellent.  Our orders were taken promptly, the correct food arrived, and my burger and fries were hot and fresh.  I tried the mushroom burger with turkey and it was loaded with mushrooms.  The server even brought us fries while we waited because it was taking longer than ten minutes.  She made sure to keep our water glasses full.  If you can, try to sit in Janesca's section, and you will be well taken care of.  
     The other servers I had gotten bad service from still work there as I saw a few of them walking around.  Hopefully they have improved since my bad experiences.  The only other complaint I have is this place really needs to be dusted!  It doesn't look dirty other than that, but where the carousel horses are along-side the booths is coated with a thick layer of dust.  If they fix that, I would come back more often.",-1
"Friendly staff, but disappointed in what I got. My grilled cheese's bread was burnt. For $6 (and .48 because I used my credit card) I was expecting better.",-1
"Every dam time we come here it's an issue!!! Either the steak isn't cooked right or hair in the plate or a piece of something in the kitchen got in the plate smh I try always giving the benefit of the doubt but this is far beyond that!!! The manager don't even care.. all he said was sorry instead of saying hey we will cook it to your liking or do you want something else instead!!! Nope he just came to the table and said oh sorry and walked away!!!!  

His name is Amonte or something like that!!! 
I don't mind paying whatever for a good meal but this is ridiculous!!!! The waitress on the hand was awesome!!!",-1
Apartment is falling apart there is no insulation they don't repair anything. You can never get in touch with anyone the amenities are non existent there is no gate the pool is closed. The forced trash service sucks. Insects get in all the broken windows. They do anything to get you to move in and NOTHING to fix anything. You can hear your neighbors pee and everything else! Everyone has the same complaints it's crazy. We are trying to buy a house as soon as we find one we are out of here it's ridiculous. See pictures! Don't move here it's not worth it.,-1
"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the States.  Partial emotional (as that is where I met my husband) but more than that, their shrimp and grits are LITERALLY to die for.  I had them on a first date with my husband and asked him ""do you mind if I lick the bowl?""  I woke up dreaming about them.

Every time we go back to N.O. We make reservations there and it has NEVER failed to please!!",1
"Our dinner was amazing but it's was the service that sucked.
We asked for booth got seated at a table repeated that we wanted a booth so many booths was available the hostess goes those are for a later party(later came & no it wasn't) but there was one booth just needed to be clean she clean it really quick then we sat down took a min for our waiter to ask what we want for our drinks once order they came out quick. Then we order our food. Took a long time for salads & the biscuits our main meal came out first it was bought out by someone else & not waiter by time we found our waiter he said he thought the girl bought out our salads & biscuits. He said he'll take care of it that took a minute to come out as well. We ate our main meal then salad & biscuits. Yeah it's all going in the same place but it's certain order we wanted to eat our food & this first time I had to wait a while on simple service at least bring out the biscuits right at the beginning",-1
"I visited this location on several occasions this last week and was thoroughly disappointed on every visit. From employees too busy joking with each other to help customers, to waiting for my drink because they made the drinks and food for their regulars first to having an employee offer to help, then walked away from the counter to go do something else, which resulted in my having to bet back into line and wait again. My Vanilla Latte is what you would expect from a Starbucks, consistent and good, but the customer service will keep me from coming back.",-1
"My 3-star rating is really not based on anything... I just wanted to post a heads up:

I went there today to buy some chocolate for a gift, and they were closed, with no hours or anything posted in the window. I checked their website, and it says they are ""currently only open every for private parties and events."" 

Bummer, because I'd heard great things and really wanted to check it out.",-1
"Review for HOTEL only
Stayed here on a stop over on the way to Vegas. It's right off the I-80 east but not close enough to hear any freeway noise. The room was clean, quiet and everything worked. Hot water, water pressure, A/C and heat worked. The bed was comfortable. I was on the 3rd floor and couldn't hear my neighbors through the wall at all. The only noise came from under the door, standard for most hotels I suppose, but nothing too bad. The quality of the stay in terms of the price is unbeatable. The room was $47 on a Sunday night. I'm sure it might be slightly higher for the weekend. The room is dated in terms of furniture but if that is not a big deal(which it isn't for me) then the stay is well worth the price. Included are some photos and there was some patchwork in the shower but again, I don't think that's a big deal.
I will stay here again",1
"First and foremost, this place is worth the wait. If you are planning to eat here, and didn't come before opening, expect at least a 20-30 minute wait if you're lucky. We got here right when the doors opened and only had to wait 20 minutes to get seated. The food is everything it's hyped up to be, and the service was really great. So, as said earlier, this place is worth the wait.",1
"Took my family (party of 6 - kids aged 16,10,9, & 30 months) for the day (July 3rd, a Sunday). If you are uncomfortable in a diversely ethnic and racial environment than this place isn't for you. We have a blended family (Caucasian and Latino) and are from Brooklyn, Queens, and the Lower East Side & Harlem. We felt as if we were in our normal elements around the way and not 2 hours away from home in an otherwise non-descript South West Jersey town. Contrary to some who use the word ghetto to represent the clientele here, it's simply not the case. Again, it's ethnically and racially diverse- mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends - all trying to have the best time they could during their time off from work!

I felt that there was plenty of parental supervision, I noticed only seniors/elderly family members sitting off on the sides and most parents/guardians aged from 18 to 60 were actively waking around and/or with their children in the water environment.

Paid $25 (due to googling ""Sahara Sam promo code"") per ticket and felt this was a very fair price for the amenities offered.

Took a star away because there needs be better instruction at the front door advising what needs to be done if you are either a 1)season ticket holder, 2) walk up purchaser, or 3) online purchaser and what you must do if you have bags with you. Basically you go inside if you already have your tickets with or without bags to convert them to wristbands at the counter. Everyone with bags must go inside for a bag check. Someone outside would have saved about 8 minutes of my families time and probably the time of countless other confused souls.

The facility appearing well maintained overall - paint fresh and vivid, not chipping, no rust visible.

It was clean. The water appeared clean and hygienic relative to the amount of people present.

It gets busy, I would say about 90% capacity, the earlier the better. The ability to use the outdoor facility helps balance the flow between areas.

The smell of chlorine is there, I'd say play inside for a bit, go outside get some air, then come back in...remember - your in a normally enclosed area (even tho the roof does open).

Staff appeared helpful with flow of smaller children, life guards were attentive to children in water areas - felt safe. Seen many genuine smiles from The staff.

Didn't purchase food there - left it in the car and went out to eat it at the car, no food or drinks allowed from the outside inside the facility - which makes sense to protect their business interest - but they let you do as you place in the parking area! Plus, their price list is available as a picture on Yelp - scroll through - and if you don't
Like the prices bring sandwiches or go down the
Block to McDonalds - otherwise deal with the prices and food quality - it's a water park not a gourmet restaurant!

We will go back again as it is a good value for $25 each ticket (use the discount promo codes online)!! 

The kids loved it. No complaints from them.

And you get drinks at the bar and can bring them throughout the facility (Long Island Iced Tea $9.50 - best value for alcohol served).",1
"The place is small and tackily decorated, which I actually don't dislike for a neighborhood thai place. But the food? Not at all good:

My husband got the chicken pho and complained of it having a horribly underseasoned broth, super dry/chewy chicken, and quite literally three little pieces of chicken and a few floating vegetables. It was really just a big bowl of noodles in hot water. Not at all worth $10.

I had the pad thai, which actually nauseated me. The smell was terrible, the sauce was overly sweet with a weird, this-might-have-been-made-yesterday flavor going on. Again, I had like three pieces of carrot, two baby corns, and a few mini florets of broccoli. The tofu was just terrible, as if they used super soft instead of firm in a dish like pad thai. And again, just noodles aplenty. It was supposed to be TOFU + VEGETABLE pad thai. 

The appetizer, spring rolls, were served way too hot and had no flavor.

I'm not at all into bashing restaurants, but I will never go back there. On the walk home, I exclaimed aloud ""I wish I could vomit so that I can eat dinner again"".",-1
"Its been 6 months since our wedding and my wife and I still can't get over the spectacular job Michael and Anna did with both our proposal and wedding!! 
They are hands down a superstar team!! I used Anna to photograph my wedding proposal in Santa Barbara and we were absolutely blown away by the quality and creativity of the pictures we received. It was a busy day on a private winery and she took advantage of all the different views and sceneries!! On top of that she's an absolute sweetheart and makes you feel completely at ease!! 

Months later, even though we were getting married in southern california I asked Michael and Anna to shoot our wedding since no one else would do it justice. Again they exceeded my expectations!! They really make you feel like royalty and the pictures they produce are top notch!! Complete professionals from start to finish!! Its been 6 months since our wedding and we literally show our wedding and engagement photo's at just about every dinner party we host!! Love these two, just an absolute honor to work with them!! Thanks again!!",1
"Con artists work here. I ordered chicken and rice, which they advertise 1 entree and one side for $4.99. I go to pay and they charge me $6 and change. Very slight difference but somehow I noticed it and questioned it. The woman said I didn't say I wanted the $4.99 then said she gave me double meat. If that was double meat I would hate to see a regular order. I know it's only a dollar but it's the principle. I get that chick fil a is taking their business and that's why I wanted to help them out, next time I'm going to chick fil a. 

Bummer because the food was pretty good.",1
We are still improving and alot has to be done. But overnights are alot better now that we have ppl willing to work for our customers. I heard the horror stories from a few years ago. Nothing is like that now. Soon we will be serving breakfast all day and night long. Our shake machines are down at 12am-6am for automatic cleaning. You dont want to eat fungus do you? Didnt think so. As far are frappas they are open all night long. Ice coffee is limited but can be made on a special request. I work the grill. I make sure all our customers get fresh food every single time. Its my duty to give you the kind of sandwich that you ordered through our cashier. Im a one man team who works in the grill area. I cant be responsible for what happens beyond the sandwiches. I hear every single order as you tell it to the cashier. I'm not crying out for $15 an hour . im just happy to have a job and take very much pride in my work. If we are not selling ice cream frappas or ice coffee please understand that we must clean the machines before we can serve them. Nobody is trying to get anyone sick over old product. Not while im there they won't. I been in mcdonalds far to long to allow customers to get sick on my watch. So we do apologize in advance and hope you completely understand. NEW MANAGEMENT NEW WAY OF MCDONALDS. Welcome back everyone.,1
"I stopped using Yelp because I became lazy and didn't feel like spending 10-15 after eating to write about a restaurant, but this place changed my way of thinking!

Federal Donuts opened up in my neighborhood 5-6 years ago and I never stopped in to try it out. After hear one raving review after another, I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).

Upon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar ""fresh and hot"" donuts, and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60, which I believe is quite expensive.

The cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right, but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.

The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.

The cinnamon sugar donut...just, wow. These people don't lie when they say it's ""hot and fresh."" It was warm, soft, moist, and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality. 

Despite the price being a little high, I will definitely be back to try their other varieties of donuts and chicken. 10/10 (or 5/5, according to Yelp).",1
"Food is solid and they have many unique options such as elk and wild boar. Definitely check out their menu if you are interested. Small portion compared to most burger places. The only downside is that the service is super slow - not enough waiter/waitresses. To be honest, this place doesn't have to be a sit down restaurant and will do just fine allowing self service. My roommate and I waited over 40 minutes for our burgers, which was a bit annoying.",-1
"It's getting to be a challenge as I'm really looking for a good Mexican restaurant here in Reno, I'm beginning to believe there are none in existence here. I'm used to Mexican foods from the S.F. bay area...This place does not cut the grade...

Hey Reno, what's with the small portions? Maybe due to the war we are engaged in that food is being rationed? Or is business that bad? 

Cold rice, chicken over cooked and dry (both my G/F's & my dish), my enchiladas was cold, red sauce tasted weird. G/F's flour tortilla was browned in cold grease as it didn't really brown, just sucked up the grease. My soda was flat, not enough carbonation to it....was also warm that the ice melted within 5 minutes of taking it to the table, so soda got watered down...

The candle center piece in the center of the table was glued down so one has to eat to the side of the table...very strange. 

I ordered a burrito and it's not Cali style, it's more a style of what you would find in the freezer section of your supermarket. yea on the small child size. Cali burritos are BIG, plentiful and filling. It also sort of tasted like it was re-heated, not freshly made...I would dine there only as a last resort...",-1
"Wasn't horrible.  First time visit. What made me visit was the photo of the shrimp and grits they posted on Facebook. (Sponsored post, I believe)  I see a lot of reviews that rave about the cheesy grits, so I had high expectations!  Unfortunately, I was let down.  The price was $12.99. Not outrageous, but I felt there could have been more grits on the plate. The plate was very shallow, but wide.  As for the taste of the grits, I was ready to have awesome, cheesy grits, but to me, they were lacking in cheesy flavor. The shrimp were flavorful and cooked well. The bacon in the dish was excellent, so it wasn't a complete bust, but I would not order it again. My wife had an omelet which she said was very tasty.  If we go back, I would like to try the fried green tomatoes.  That is IF we go back.",1
"I was having an bad migraine and felt terrible. When woke up I had a sinus infection and my day was just going awful. I called a few places to try to get a massage in today because I knew indeed it badly. No one had any availability and I stumbled across massage envy on Google and thought to give them a try. Not only were they able to fit me in with the exact specific type I needed, but they also were able to fit my father in at the exact same time. Jen was understanding and nice, she asked me questions and checked up on me constantly. She even showed me some at home techniques I could use. She took her time, obviously did not rush. Carrie, I believe, was the name of the woman who did a foot massage on my father. He was very pleased and recommended I try it sometime. They also informed me about the membership program which not only is very cost-efficient, but also adheres to my busy schedule. I signed up on the spot with no hesitation. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, comfortable building and very calming environment! Would recommended! I feel so much better already and am going back in a month to get a 90 minute massage.",1
"This place was ok. The parking is free which is honestly unheard of in this area so that was good. Couple things that weren't good were that I reserved a concierge level room and when I got there was told there weren't any available but I got concierge access with a normal room. Interesting though as several folks checked in after me and got rooms on that level. I did check out the concierge lounge and it was TINY, i mean like closet sized so not sure it's worth it to pay more for that anyway. Also my keys didn't work to come from parking the car to the hotel so I had to walk down 3 ramps to go to the main entrance... when i told the front desk she was like ok and that was it. Wifi was good but I'll definitely stick with Marriott.",-1
"When I was with Charter 10 years ago their service was intermittent and customer service was horrendous. I've been a happy customer of AT&T DSL for the last eight years, but was repeatedly approached by Charter stating that they are now the best in the country, their whole network was revamped and that they now have zero issues. I signed up with Charter as of August 1 and the last 4 days were horrendous. The initial tech who was setting up the service was entirely incompetent and was asking ME questions about the router and the modem. The connection was lightning fast for about 2 days. As of yesterday the signal became weak, pages are taking 30-45 seconds to load and sometimes there is no connection at all. I called Charter and spent 15 minutes on hold, then talked to someone who hung up on me and was finally able to schedule a technician to bring a ""signal booster"" to my place. I live in Central St. Louis, not in a rural area, so apparently their ""best in the nation"" network still leaves much to be desired.",-1
"I seen this ad and thought what a cute name, i called for appointment and to verify if they accepted my insurance, the girl was not able to answer, so i figure I'd  go anyway, i was treated very nice and was advised they can give me a free consultation but in fact it was not free they get you into the room and than tell you they must charge.. so where the free consultation, i got up and walked out. Never going back",-1
"I decided it was finally time to get my eyebrows waxed, as I've been putting it off and putting it off for years. I began looking around at other reviews for local salons and Salon L'Etoile had gotten rave reviews about their waxing and brow shaping services. I made an appointment and was lucky enough to get one for the same day, later that afternoon with Ashley. There were two women at the front desk who greeted me as I arrived. Both ladies were very pleasant and one escorted me up to the second floor waiting room. She spoke about the other services they provide. 

The waiting room is dimly lit and their is soft music playing throughout. I think they accidentally double booked Ashley, as I waited 15-20 minutes, which wasn't that big a deal (in my opinion). Ashley met me and brought me into the treatment room, where she also had music playing. She asked me what I was looking for and walked me through the process. She got to work right away and even asked if the temperature of the wax was OK. She also filled my brows in with a pencil before letting me see the finished look. I am very happy with my brows. She listened when I said I didn't want them too thin and she didn't try to change my look. I will definitely be returning in 5 weeks and will recommend to friends in the area.",1
"Well, good food, reasonable price. But as they themselves advertised, the service is indeed slow. I waited 20 mins to get my water, and another 10 mins to place the order, and yet another 20 mins to get the food. I went there twice. Both time, I experience good food + slow services. 

Will I come again? Well, maybe. I will make sure I sit inside or near the door at porch so that servers could see me.",1
"Prior to booking this hotel, I didn't see the reviews from the guests who had problems with bed bugs. I'm sure this was a true experience for them and hopefully the hotel took care of the problem and provided recourse for those guests. My experience was a little different. The room I had was really nice. Everything was clean and nicely decorated. The shower felt really good. You can tell they've made some upgrades because the decor is very modern. The biggest perk with this hotel is that it's conveniently located in the airport. You don't have to walk outside or catch a shuttle to get there. To that end, the hotel is sound proof so you don't hear the airplanes hovering over you. Customer service was nice. Food in the restaurant took forever, but tasted very good. Everything is decently priced. You won't feel robbed.",1
Horrible horrible!!! Got a flat tire.. took them 3 hours to send somebody!! I know the flat tire happens but 3 hours??!! When I was only 20 min from the rental car center... I will never use them again.. I travel every week and thought I would give them a try..,-1
"This hotel sits right in front of the arch! Didn't get an arch view but thats ok. Had an amazing king bed w a great bathroom and amazing shower! Scored the room thru hotwire for $59! Only issue was w the valet. I waited for my car for 25 minutes. I walked over to the valet counter and told them this was ridiculous and I need my car to get on the road back to kansas city. One of the valets told me ""it's coming."" Really? So the valet goes back to to the desk and Lo and behold the car was less than 3 feet away!! I was extremly livid and dissapointed. The valet was $18 and I feel tha I did not get my $18 worth. I immediatley called management and complained. I told them If this was a instance when I was having to be at the airport by a certain time, i could have missed my flight. They comped me the $18. This didn't spoil my trip as I will be coming back to this hotel next time I come back to STL",1
"I thought the food was terribly greasy. Even the plate of broccoli and cauliflower left a coating of oil on the bowl. The sausage and potatoes were soaked in oil--the potatoes were browned nicely, but the sausage had no color on them and the onions weren't sautéed well. The the only thing I could taste in the eggplant balls were the breadcrumbs, and the pomodoro sauce was very watery. The white pizza had great flavor, but was extremely greasy. I soaked it up with my napkin. 

Service was lacking. No one checked on us after the food came out. My glass of wine arrived after the first plate. When I told the host (owner?) of these issues when he stopped at our table, he just shrugged his shoulders and said ""ok.""

We will not be back.",-1
"Don't trust Adina to do your wedding hair, she canceled mine 2 weeks before my wedding day... It's taken me a while to write this review but it still bothers me what happened. I booked Adina to do my bridal hair for my wedding about a year and a half ago. Things seemed to be going good, did a couple trials to get the style I wanted, then 2 weeks before my wedding Adina contacts me via Facebook to tell me she double booked and had to cancel my bridal hair. When I responded completely freaking out, she took a long time to respond to me, leaving me in a panic. When she finally responded she said she was trying to find me a replacement stylist. I don't know how you make such a big mistake to double book the most important day of a women's life but to also not realize it until 2 weeks before the big day. There I was 2 weeks before my wedding having to frantically somehow do the nearly impossible of finding a stylist on extremely short notice for wedding day bridal hair. Although I did manage to find someone, we didn't have time to do a trial and although the new stylist did her best, my hair didn't look how I wanted it on my wedding day. Friends and family tell me they think because I only booked her to do my hair and not my entire bridal party, she got an offer to do a bridal party that day and thought of an excuse to cancel mine. I'm sure Adina will deny this accusation which I don't know to be the case or not and honestly I don't care what the reason why, there's no excuse for what she did. Although hair may seem like a minor thing to be concerned with for your wedding in the big scheme of things, we all want to look our best, how we invisioned ourselves on our special day and this was taken away from me because of the irresponsibleness of Adina.",-1
"Food is very good here and it's basically unlimited, so you must go hungry and plan to spend a lot of time - I mean hours - to make the price worth it per person. 

The banchan assortment needs work, but more on that in a moment. 

I found it a little weird to have kbbq and chinese style hot pot at the same place,  BUT this IS Pinellas county so variety is pretty limited in these food genres, so I consider it a smart move on the owners part. 

You get the option to have both hot pot and kbbq together or you can do them separately. We tried them both since it was our first visit, but wouldn't do them together again as they just don't pair well in one sitting. 

Both food styles are your traditional setup and ingredients, and it's completely self service.  The only thing staff will bring you is whatever meats, menu items and drinks you order.  You cook everything and get all your own condiments and banchan from the condiment bar. If you are seated toward the back, it's a tad inconvenient because there are no serving trays, only small plates and bowls so you make a lot of trips. 

The table grills and hotpots are all very safe. Induction heat and no open flames. Smart. You control your own grill temps too. Countless places I've been for kbbq normally will have staff come tend your grill and deliver your bancahn dishes, but here its ALL you. 

The hotpot was pretty so-so to average, so I focused mostly on the kbbq. 

The food and marinades are good quality and fresh with a huge assortment of meats and raw vegetables to cook, but the banchan variety is very very limited to a few pickled items and about 3 types of kimchis. I'm accustomed to a much wider variety of banchan, which is always my favorite part of kbbq. Was kind of disappointed in that area. 

The atmosphere is pretty hip, clean, and dark. Nicely decorated for a long stay, and the staff was very friendly.",1
"The exceptional customer service I received even before I was in town made this place worthwhile. As a visitor, I reached out on Facebook asking if they could make a reservation for two for brunch. I don't believe they normally make reservations, but they were very kind and willing. As soon as we arrived, they had our seat ready and they were expecting us.

Our meals were tasty, I had the Chicken or the Egg special, and loved the $15 bottomless drinks, which you could switch out between a bloody mary, mimosa and sangria for no extra cost. Our waitress was very friendly.

To top it all off, the owner/head chef visited our table as he knew we were ""the people from Facebook."" He thanked us for our business, chatted with us about our hometown for a while and gave us his business card with personal cell phone number for us to call if we needed anything while we were in town! Talk about friendly!",1
"I had Cucina Zapata for the first time last week and it did not disappoint! I ended up getting the Cap'n Crunch tilapia burrito and it was delicious. It was a huge burrito, stuffed to the max, and only $6!! My co-workers say cucina zapata is one of, if not the best food trucks you can find by Drexel's campus, and they're not wrong. However, because of their popularity, expect to wait a few minutes for your order- the wait wasn't too bad, but just be aware there might be a line to order as well as a line to pick up.",1
"I went here with a friend to kill some time before seeing a movie next door.  The atmosphere is cozy, and indie rather than corporate looking.  I got a mug of hot chocolate (standard size) and picked up a chocolate bar from the counter display for later.  There was no price on the chocolate bar or the display, but the total for these two things came out to around $12.  Whatever the breakdown was, at least one of these items was vastly overpriced.  They were good, though, so that earns the place an extra star.  One of the other reviews mentioned that high-schoolers hang out here.  They must have some good part-time jobs.",1
"This is not an authentic sushi place.  If you are going to order spicy tuna and salmon then this the places for you, else wait for dinner and head over to Double Knot",1

"I had high tea with a friend here and while the tea was outstanding, the sandwiches were nothing special. They were things that I could make better at home and not what I would typically expect from a $16.95 High Tea service. The service was not very good either, as one of the ladies was pretty rude to us most of the time. My friend spilled her tea a bit because it got stuck on the saucer and she just threw her a napkin and kept talking to the table next to us telling them ""sorry about that"" like we were an inconvenience.  It took my friend 15 minutes to even get her back over to get her a new saucer. There were not that many people there so it's not like it was a busy day. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back here, but if I did, it would be just to get tea and nothing else.",-1
"Pizza was so good! First time trying today and ordered online. A little mess up with their system so they didn't get my order in time. The guy called me back, told me he was making the pizza in a rush and wasn't charging me for it. 20 minutes later he came to the door himself with my Fresh, hot pizza and 2 brownies all for free. 
He was very apologetic. Customer service was fantastic and food was awesome. This is my new go to delivery joint.",1
"Last night we are out with friends and though we would try a new Resturant. What a mistake, starting right from service walking in, people were confused and didn't know even where to seat us. We had a reservation. 
The server was fine, the meals were not to any of our liking, service was far below average. I think since they already have a Resturant in Philadelphia, they can do anything they want. 
We would never return and were will pass this on to many in South Jersey.",-1
"It was the first time of me being at a Korean BBQ place. We got both the hot pot and BBQ. It was like a buffet style, we got unlimited amount of food. The food was good, they had a lot of options. There was also a salad bar and a sauce bar. Would go back again.",1
"Ignorant bartender. Took forever for him to wait on you at a table on a Sunday afternoon, not even during football season.  Lesson learned. Never have a bartender wait on you for food.  Number 1, they don't want to do it, but also, they don't know the menu or anything about the kitchen when you ask a question. This is a typical suburban blue collar and millennial underwhelming establishment to watch Sports in with a pint of flat Budweiser. It is perfect for blue collars who swear that walk in dressed like they just finished a 10 hr day either painting, fixing drains, or laying down planks, or up on a roof. After 10 or 11pm the DB millennials roll in, espec on weekends.",-1
"Review Summary: Ambience: 4/5     Food: 5/5       Service: 4/5 

If you're tired of all the fancy Stephen Starr joints around town and need to try something new, Marrakesh is the place to see. Located off South Street, its entrance is a dark maroon door complete with an iron knocker. Please be sure to come with friends; as other reviews have stated Marakkesh's six course meal really packs a punch. 

The food was mouthwateringly GOOD. I came here with one other person (rookie mistake) on a quiet Thursday evening, and the waiters were very attentive to us. Everything was delicious without being overly oily. For our first main course we ordered the Spicy Chicken in Cumin Sauce, and for the second Tajine of Lamb. These dishes are meant to be eaten by hand, which we did, but I saw some tables eating with cutlery. Full disclosure, the fruits do come with their labels unpeeled, though I wasn't too worried about that because they were the juiciest, sweetest batch I've had since coming to the States. 

We were about to leave when the manager (owner?) emerged from the backroom and told us to stick around to see the belly dancer. I thought this was a really nice gesture, as the dancer had been hired by a large group upstairs and he really did not have to share this information with us.  

My one critique, if you can call it that, is directed at Marrakesh's decor. True to its Moroccan roots everything from the furniture to the walls is covered with dark, heavy fabric. Perhaps it is a personal bias, but I found the place to be a little stuffy, and I could not tell how clean everything was. All in all, a MUST TRY!",1
"There was a time when all i wanted to do was have an old fashioned at pub and kitchen, eat some meatloaf and take in my ipod playlist on the speakers.  It's changed considerably.  i don't know if the food quality dropped with the economy, but even their burgers are failing.  The only thing i recently had there with which i was impressed was sauteed swiss char with almonds and cranberries.  (It was really well cooked with no bitter and all the flavor, just like char is supposed to taste).  Their oysters are good if you're lucky enough to get there on a west coast day, but even then, they seem to get the small batches.  
A real regret is that whatever bartender made me fall in love with the old fashioned has since wandered into a place of cheap watered down bourbon and cloying bitters.  A real shame for a bourbon cherry to go bad in a drink like that.  
Oh, and who took the doughnuts?  Really?  Of all the dessert items, you took the homemade doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce?  For shame!
I'm hoping that as the winter rolls closer, we'll see the meatloaf again, with mushy peas, and mashed potatoes like a good simple urban hipster bar should class up.  For now, meh on all fronts except the neat interior and pretty awesome wait staff.",-1
"This place is something out of a sci-fi movie. I went in with a broken iPhone 5s screen that I needed to get replaced and I swear, when I turned around to look at phone cases, this guy must have popped out 4 more arms and used telekinetic powers to disassemble and reassemble the phone with the new iPhone screen. By the time I got done looking at phone cases on the wall (approximately 63 seconds) I turned to walk back to the counter to watch him repair my phone, but he already turned back to his normal human form with two arms and all the phone parts he had flying around with his telekinetic powers have been put away already as he was walking back to the counter to hand me the phone back. If you need a phone fixed, and fixed fast, I highly recommend going here, but I wouldn't recommend breaking your phone on purpose to try and catch a picture of the experience, by the time you get your camera out, the phone will be fixed already and he will be asking you if you want to pay by cash or credit.",1
"We are visiting from Indiana for the month. It was time for my daughter to  go back to Indiana and I discovered this place through Yelp. When we got to The Three Coins Diner we thought oh my. Are we going to be safe in this neighborhood and what kind of food are we going to get?

We entered the restaurant and we were told to seat ourselves. We looked at the menu and the prices were very reasonable. We ordered our meals.  Our meals were huge! My daughter had french toast and fruit. The fruit bowl was huge! My son had the country fried steak and eggs. I had 2 eggs, 4 pieces of bacon and 2 pancakes.  The food was great and so was the waitress. Our waitress kept coming up and asking if we wanted anything else. We haven't had service like that in a long time.  We will be coming back to this restaurant for sure!!!!",1
"This was the third time I've been to this place, as it's close to my work so I've had an opportunity to try a few items on the menu.  Overall the portions that I get served are so small for the price when compared to other places in town, and the food just doesn't come off as very fresh.  Maybe it's a good place for drinks, I don't know, but I'm not too interested in a fourth visit.",-1
"I was in search of an eye doctor and thought going to a convenient Clarkson Eyecare couldn't be too bad a choice. When I scheduled my appointment, the woman on the phone was extremely friendly and I was able to get in within a day! I also got a phone call and email reminder about my appointment, which was nice. Upon arrival for my eye exam, I checked in and waited just a couple minutes before I was helped. The exam went incredibly quickly, and Dr. Tubbs was very friendly. He seemed to want to keep things as simple as possible and get me on my way. When it came to paying, I did have a copay and had to pay something extra for the contact lens exam. No big deal. Eyecare is expensive. I did look into ordering contacts through Clarkson and found them to be WAY more expensive than places like 1800Contacts, Costco, and Walmart. I told the lady I was not interested in purchasing through them because of the price difference. She did tell me that Clarkson Eyecare is willing to match competitors' prices to a point, so definitely keep that in mind. Overall, Clarkson Eyecare is a chain eye care place but they accept all kinds of insurance, and I felt very well care for there.",1
"I've eaten at this restaurant many years ago on Walnut St. ......should I say, this ""infamous"" establishment.....ha ha ha !! Of course, the gentleman I was dating at the time, wanted to experience so much of what Philly had to offer ie, restaurants. My on the other hand, takes much to impress me..the decor, Hmmm? not much to be desired for, the lighting was very dimmed, I suppose this was to be ""romantic""...bad on the eyes, when it was time to read the menu. I ordered ""Porterhouse"" my all time favorite....these steaks costs $35-40 me being the analytical person that I am , simply because, I am a steak lover...this steak at that  particular time, did ""NOT"" taste any different than the one I had eaten at ""CAPITAL GRILLE"" not so long ago..or the ""CHART HOUSE""....not even ""RUTH CHRIS"", which is one of my favorite restaurants. It's how the Chef prepares & cooks the steak..overall, they're the same steak...BUT !!!! your paying for the name of the RESTAURANT & the LOCATION . 

SYNOPSIS: Some of us tend to think if, we eat at these FABULOUS restaurants / at these GREAT locations ....FIREWORKS are going to go off in our BRAINS...ANGELS will sing. UNFORTUNATELY !!! things like this does NOT happen simply because, we're eating an $30-40 STEAK ...I REALIZED / ACCEPTED this when I had eaten at this restaurant many years ago.",1
"This was my second time eating here and it did not disappoint. If you want to make it here for dinner, be sure to go early or you will have to wait. My family of four tried to come around 7:30pm last time and the wait was an hour so we were disappointed to have to drive all this way and not get seated even though we called ahead of time and was told that there was no wait. This time, our family of five got in right before seven and was seated right away!

  We came here for the fresh uni. We ordered both specials of the day: fresh uni and king salmon. We also ordered the happy meal, stolen treasure, spicy Dan Dan noodles and the mixed feed me menu of five course non-raw and raw items.  The feed me menu came with fried pompano, lion's head soup, tuna rose, lemonfish rose and raw pompano with yellow kiwi. 
  
  The food came pretty quickly and very presentable. The portions are on the small side. Everything we ordered was delicious except the cheese they added on the king salmon was out of place and almost ruined the culinary experience.  The uni by itself was a great experience! I've never had uni mixed in a citrus twist before. I've had it at sushi restaurants with a thin slice of lemon or straight out of the shell for the ultimate oceanic, briny taste. 

  Another slight error was the miscommunication between the waiter and the chef. The chef told our waiter that our table was done with the food when we didn't get any of the raw items we ordered from the feed me menu. Luckily, I said something or we would have not been able to try the great lemonfish! The chef personally brought out our last dish, the raw pompano and apologized for the long wait for our food, which made the dinner all the better. 

   Another plus about Luvi is that they have a  machine that seals the cups like at the boba tea place, for kids' drinks and drinks to go. Follow them on Instagram so you can see when they have uni. Overall, this is a great culinary experience but if you have a big appetite, you might leave here not fully satiated because of the small portions. Both times that I visited Luvi, I had to grab gelato at Piccola Gelateria afterwards!",1
"I purchased two apple trees from Magic Garden late this spring/early summer. 
First Chris, one of the sales managers, asked me exactly where we lived and suggested different trees than those I had thought of initially. He explained about the differences in weather/heat/cold conditions etc. He was very knowledgeable.
Then a few weeks after planting the trees I noticed one was not doing well....it was losing leaves and looking miserable. It had been VERY hot and windy...and as it turned out I was not compensating with enough water for the extreme weather we were having. I called Chris and he explained how to properly provide enough water for the trees and lo and behold...the sad apple tree sprang back to life with wonderful new greenery within about 10 days and the other one which I thought had been doing well, doubled the number of leaves and began flowering.
I think that the staff at Magic Garden not only sells appropriate plants for your needs but really understands how to care for them.
I will continue going back to Magic Garden over the coming years!!!",1
I've been coming here since I was a kid. Always great. Stopped by for lunch and was totally ignored. While I was not in her station Sue took it upon herself to assist me and got my drink order. The waitress I was supposed to have finally came over and asked me what I wanted. I told her I was already being helped and Sue finished the service. I was just about to leave when Sue approached me. Thank you Sue. Now I still have great feelings about this wonderful Florida institution that is Ted Peters.,1
"The staff are lovely and the interior is modern, but the food is entirely mediocre. Small portion sizes, which would be fine except that these ""tapas"" are priced up to $20. The fried chicken was tasty, but the herb garlic chicken was just bizarre in taste. And somehow each dish was topped with the same spring greens mix for no apparent reason than to take up more space on the plate. It's a nice trendy place for a drink, but go only for the atmosphere and not for the food.",1
"This small Italian eatery is located just off Magazine street in the lower, much lower Garden District. I was here with a group of 7 and we sampled the salads and pizza for the most part. The pizza for New Orleans was not terrible, but not particularly great either. The salads were at best ok. The service was disorganized and the staff appeared overwhelmed even though it was only half full.",-1
"If you're from NY or north jersey then these bagels cannot compare to those bagels. Night and day. These bagels are huge tough dough balls. They are no better than what you'd get at a grocery store. If you're from around the area, then you'll find them ok, but they are nothing like a real NY bagel.",-1
Food is bomb.  Plus good servers.  Right by river.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by eating here.,1
"This place is a zoo , it puts all other walmarts to shame.  the employees are slow and probably not paid enough , i can never find what im looking for because the shelves are always empty , like really? your job is to reorder empty stock and you cant even do that well",-1
"Not the best location as far as accessibility and consistence but leaps better than any other Santa Barbara location. I just wish that said something positive. All ventura locations taste immensely better. 

Edit- chicken was RAW. not even cooked. Almost feed it to my toddler. After a nasty food poisoning incident at the other SB location I doubt ill return to this one either.",-1
"25 Sep 2018

We went in and found the establishment was worn. It was difficult to read the menu. The menu did not say one could purchase an individual piece of chicken. The lady behind the counter was as slow as molasses in the wintertime.

When we finely stepped up to the counter the employee was unable to address my questions about the menu. Her speech was inaudible.

I asked if she spoke english, I'm pretty sure she did, but not very well. My wife and I walked out without ordering.

We will not be back.",-1
"This is sushi for philistines, all sauce and fried things. The spicy tuna is so spicy you won't taste the tuna at all. Flavorful and heavy, like pub food. We got nigiri as a palette cleanser, I don't think there was any vinegar in the rice at all (which is what sushi means). It was good, but not what I expected. Like when you invite a couple friends over for a quiet kickback and it turns into a rager. Fun in an overestimating kind of way.",-1
"Went there last night with a party of 6. Was seated right away at a table in the back. The server was fantastic.
As for the food.....Spicy feta was to die for. The garlic potato dip was exceptional. 
I got the shrimp in lemon and oil as the main course. The shrimp were cooked over charcoal and that made all the difference. Skipped dessert since we were there for my birthday and we had cake at the house. I left stuffed and I cannot wait to return.",1
"I'm home writing this review because the pool at the Y is closed, contradicting its schedule. This happens not infrequently, and is important because there are hardly any daytime lap swim hours, so that the lanes are jammed with 3 or 4 people trying to circle swim in each lane at the same time. Classes often intrude on lap swim time as well. Rec swim (kids' times) is also exasperating - you must stay with kids under age 7 in a small and confined area of the pool at all times and cannot lap swim. Every time we go we discover new rules from the lifeguard about this or that thing they can't do. Front desk staff is nice, at least. I've been a member for over a year and wish I could quit, but there aren't better options anywhere else nearby.",-1
"The food was good, that's the only reason they got 2 stars! The hostess was less then enthusiastic and barley greeted us when we were being seated. The waitress only checked on us once after serving our food. The hostess came around with water and saw my husbands glass was empty but he had sprite. Rather than getting one for him or informing the waitress we waited for another 10 minutes and flagged the waitress down for the bill. Also some attention needed to be given to cleaning. All the doors were covered in handprints, the floors had swirl marks from mopping with a less than clean mop and the light fixtures and air vents were dusty. We aren't from the area and had to decide between barbecue and the Chinese place in the plaza. Should have gone with Chinese!",-1
"I feel bad I went in a couple months ago and forgot to review.  anywhoooo the Jars of Toast is delish.  I got to say my friend and I had just about everything on the menu.  I opted for the  cheeseburger ($12) -- Missouri grass-fed beef, roasted garlic aoli, bacon, Cheddar and a fried egg.  WOW, it was very good.  We honestly ate so much food the Chef came out and asked how we ate it all?  No problem.  I only wish I would have gotten the homemade apple butter to take home.  It was Fab.  Go there.",1
"I live right by here and I would drive across town for a gyro before eating here. 

Why do you think there is a half price Groupon for Momo's everyday? 

This used to be a fairly wild bar from what I've heard. 

Now it is a mediocre Mediterranean restaurant with obnoxious belly dancers and tacky girls from St. Charles who mistakenly think they're in downtown Clayton.",1
Service is okay. Food is delicious when it's cooked right. I got raw pizza one time. But it's safe to say that hasn't happened in awhile. They have a good beer list. I will be back !,1
"Terrible customer service.

My friends got me a gift certificate for a massage here for my birthday. I said WOW awesome let me try this place out. I called to schedule my appointment and the lady who helped me on the phone was not very helpful...
First off I'm sorry if i work 9-5 and ask for Saturdays or evening hours. Her snide remarks and attitude were just unacceptable. I didn't get her name but she was so darn rude.

Yes I understand Saturdays book up pretty far in advance but not even a ""we can take your number down so if something opens up before the 8-10 weeks out  we can contact you"".  

overall I'm not impressed. if it wasn't for the fact that my name is on my gift certificate I would totally have re-gifted this. 

I don't need some snotty/pretentious receptionist to disrespect me. Hey Rescue spa, why not take those 8-10 weeks to train your staff on how to handle customers.",-1
"This is a struggle on this one. The interior is amazing it's 5 star cozy lodge feel with nice fireplace. So much potential but really fell short...here is The Good The Bad and The Ugly.

The Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.

The Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  

The Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.

I am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.

Also side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.

PS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.

I really hope they make some of these suggested changes sooo much potential for go to spot.",-1
The food took a long time to come. If the kitchen had been fast I would have given it 5 stars.,1
The food is barely edible. Got goat biryani and goat curry. The Goat meat was tough and full of gristle. The biryani left a lot to be desired.  There are several places in Delaware that have far better tasting biryani.  Being a to go place service is non existant.,-1
"I went with about 11 of my girlfriends. The server did a great job handling all of our orders and attitudes. The oysters were great. But a few of my girls had the shrimp and grits, it was cold. Someone had the power boy which she said was great. I had the gumbo which was ok. All in all the atmosphere is great. I would go again.",1
"Doesn't look like much from the outside, but they have good food and decent service, plus they deliver in the T&C area.",1
"Yes, it's a little pricey, but it was darned near worth it. 
It certainly didn't seem a priority to get us our menus, but once they did, the service was pretty on point. The bread was good. I ordered a chopped salad and a crab cake, and the hub got a crab cake sandwich with fries. We had water to drink, no appetizers-walked out for $45 with tip. The food came quickly.  My food was great-and I'm no salad eater. The crab cake was quality, fries were good. 
Another drawback is that we had to sit in the bar area bc it was after 9. The table was the size of a chair, 3 plates were too much.

P.S. i used my bank card, and noticed that I was charged significantly more than I agreed to, so I called the restaurant. The manager said it's a banking glitch, and should correct itself before the money comes out of my account... It better.",1
"We went on a non typical day, school year mid week, so we had the luxury of being only a handful of people there  Therefore, my review may not be representative of a typical visit. 
Arrived at opening and found the off season price within reason. Bathrooms and water park were immaculate. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. 
A star was lost because I found the water and air temp to be a tad too cold. The park was smaller then other indoor water parks I've been to. Only two big slides, one group slide, a couple of younger kids areas, lazy river and a simulated surf area. They would periodically close the big slides in order to open the surf area, for lack of staffing. A minor annoyance since that is why we were there. 
I can see how people  would be upset paying more and sharing the park with hundreds of others. But I think if your timing is right, you could have an enjoyable afternoon.
We did save money by using our AAA card. Could have saved more as it was my sons birthday month, but I didn't have proof on me.",1
"You can't argue with the $6.95 lunch buffet price, and the naan is certainly very very good here.....

but,

I'm not a ""spicy food"" person.

So, I've concluded, you must know the level of ""Hotness"" you like when choosing where to dine on Indian food.

For those preferring less hot spices and more creamy or coconut flavors (like I do), you must try Indian Garden.

The ingredients here are good quality, if somewhat repetitive. I really liked the creamed vegetables and the Chicken in the tomato cream sauce because these items were less spicy hot.

For lunch, this restaurant isn't quite up to Indian Garden, where the lunch buffet costs $2 more. To keep their prices cheap, all Taste of India lunch buffet dishes are either vegetable only or with chicken.

I really like beef and lamb in my Indian food, and quickly tire of chicken everything. But for these prices, this is a minor complaint.

The owner is very personable, and took my harsh assessment of his bland chai tea (the one item I do like spicy!), to heart. Not only did he refuse to charge me for it, he hollered at the poor non-Indian guy who prepared it -- right in front of me.

Wow. I think I ruined someone's day and I'm feeling chagrinned. This was tramatic for me too and I may need a support group to get past my guilt!",-1
"Ugh, what a disappointment. My husband and I love creole, Cajun cooking and had such high hopes for this place. We had heard great things. The appetizers were great, the bloody Mary's good and the service was fantastic. So why only two stars? The entrees were not good. I had crab ravioli and it was ok. Decent sauce but not real pizazz. My husband had the jambalaya and cat fish and to be honest it seemed as if it was left overs. The jambalaya was horrible-old. The shrimp and sausage were falling apart as of cooked way too long and there was just no flavor. Very disappointing.",-1
"This is the best Thai food in St. Louis. Chicken Pad Thai that has never disappointed.. One of the very few restaurants in North County that beats all elsewhere, it's hard to even try other Thai!",1
Very surprised as this was by far the best butter chicken and aloo goobi from any Indian restaurant in the past. Service was a bit slow but worth the wait once the food came.,1
"I've been on a road trip for the past month, and had to get my Subaru Forester repaired several times along the way. Keith's has been the most helpful mechanic I have experienced so far! The waiting room was comfortable and accommodating, the employee I worked with (Jason) was very friendly and helpful. I didn't feel as though I was being pressured into anything.",1
Great layout and tvs galore. Badly needed sports bar/family restaurant in Zionsville area. Service is slow at the moment but to be expected as it is a new store with all new staff learning their systems on the fly. If you lack patience then you should wait a couple months but great set up that fills a huge void in Zville.,-1
"Waterpark was ok, bathrooms were clean, not a lot of slides but they are expanding in 2017.  We got a cabana which was very expensive but so worth it! Food was ok, but nothing to write home about.  My kids are 13 and 11 and they said they wouldn't go back because it gets really repetitive going down the same slides.  It was very busy and the lines for the slides were long.  If you live within 2 hours of the park, do not stay there over night unless you are dying to get up and go on the slides all over again.  I would suggest doing the afternoon pass, after a few hours, you are ready to go home.  Our server at the cabana was very nice, Rob B.",-1
"Amazeballs! Don't listen to the haters, get the chicken or Carne tacos. You will not be disappointed. Oh and try it with their hot sauce=WIN.",1
"Fun place, inviting interior and a pleasure to hang outside with the couches, etc. brunch food was very good, and beer selection exceptional.  Waiter, however, was a disaster.  Was jerky to us from the beginning (we were all sitting around asking each other why he was being such an asshole to us), did not know the menu at all, constantly disappeared on us, and was argumentative when he brought out the wrong order (twice).  Otherwise, would have gotten 4 stars.",1
"The experience I had renting with National at this airport wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be after reading the other reviews. There was no separate Emerald Club line that National claims all their Emerald Club Counter Service locations have, but there was only one customer ahead if me anyways so I didn't really have to wait that long. Since I am an Emerald Executive Elite Club member, all of the rental agreements were already printed out and waiting for me at the counter. All I had to do was sign the papers and take the car keys. I reserved a full size vehicle, which is the largest vehicle you are able to reserve at this location - unfortunately no premium or luxury vehicles.  I was given a pretty wide selection of cars and ended up taking the best which was the Chevy Malibu. I really wish they would have the Emerald and Executive Aisles here or offer better vehicles because it's been quite a while since I've had to drive a car with a four cylinder in it, however It did get pretty decent gas mileage. As I was a walking through the parking lot where all the rentals companies keep their cars, I noticed that Hertz had a few luxury cars parked in their aisles. So if your looking for something better than a full size, rent from them. Otherwise, National is adequate with your rental car needs. They have also solved the issue with signing the damage waiver before you drive off with your car.",1
"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!

Same as everyone else, my husband & I were very excited to have us some BBQ after our movie only to be let down by the very dry, over cooked meat, undercooked stuffed bland potato & can greenbeans.  Chef Ramsey & Irvine would have chewed Billy Bob to pieces.  

As an App we ordered the wings which tasted like cardboard & seemed as though they sat under a heating lamp for the last hour.  No ranch dipping sauce came w/ them

I ordered the pulled pork undercooked, bland bake potato.  I had to add tons of butter and sour cream so get the tatter to go down.

My husband ordered the 3-meat platter.  His meat was very dry & not flavorful.  He drowned his pulled pork in the BBQ sauce condiments from the table

The best part of our meal were the fountain drinks.

Our server Mila was very good.  Some guy came to see how our food was & walked away heading to the bar where he had a drink waiting leaving my dirty plate for someone else to pick up .  I HATE when dirty dishes are left on the table.  I do not care who you are, restaurant manager, floor manager, no-one is to good to remove the dirty dishes.

For a $48 lunch I should have stuck to my original plan of homemade fajita's!",-1
"Excellent service. Sent a request online and within 30-45 mins had a call back. Got the spot scheduled. Shanna was Prompt on arrival, very informative with prevention and such.
Checked both mine and my daughters head. Full treatment on both. 
It is a bit pricey but I already had one round and was over it all. The off the shelf stuff just doesn't work. 
The comb they use is not available in stores and gathers the nits way better. 
Only complaint is the comb should be included in the session not extra. I bought it cause I wanted to have the proper tools in case of a next time.",1
"Food, was great had BBQ nacho as an appetizer, great beer selection and great value for the price. Only bad experience was our waitress rushed us to get our order with 15 mins we had our food which being on a biz meeting made it where we had our food before our beer....",-1
"Sadly it is closed now after 62 years.  It was a very fine store and Sid Hirsch is a very fine man, and a super athlete who used to do the ultra extreme rim to rim Grand Canyon trek.",-1
"We have been on many cruises on other lines but, we wanted to take our Grandson on a nice trip and figured the Carnival Dream would be a good choice because of the Teen Club they offer. Booking the cruise was fairly easy. The embarkation and disembarkation went fairly well also. The cruise turned out fine for our Grandson but, there were a few things we didn't like. We knew this was going to be a younger crowd and the activities would be geared to that age group but, we were disappointed that there was not a little more available to the older folks as we noticed there were many families traveling with what looked to be older parents and grandparents. The food in the main dining rooms was fine and so was the Lido. The problem in the Lido was that they made you stand in line for everything and the lines were long and slow. The two pools were also very small for that size ship. So small that one could barely find a space to even stand in the water. The stateroom was very nice. It was a good size with a comfortable bed and a step in shower. The three ports were well chosen and there were more than adequate excursions to choose from. Overall, it was what we expected and our Grandson had a very good time which is what really matters.",1
"In short: Nice atmos, great food, nice portions. Mexican/ Spanish fusion Latin cuisine I suppose you could call it. On a recent getaway with my sig other in Montecito we came to this place on some Yelp recommendations. 

5 stars for the food and portions. Wine list a little overpriced...

They lost one star and ended up with 4 because the waiter didn't quite know if the plate had anything hot on it which I specifically asked NOT to have on my plate. Not into hot and spicy foods... Sure enough on a bite my head was nearly burned off to the neck from some burning hot green pepper in the mix... so I didn't appreciate that. That's a slack oversight on the part of the waiter. He obviously didn't mention it to the kitchen.


For lunches and brunches they have a nice outdoor seating area as well. Also a full bar inside. They also have a totally separate cute little building, a private VIP dining area for parties / meetings and such but with a $500 min spend.

We had a salmon and a seared sea bass entree. So, for two with an appetizer, two glasses of fine Napa Valley wine, a port and dessert to finish up our total bill with tip came to $100.",1
"I visited on a weekend night. Overall, the pizza was good and reminded me of knead dough's pizza before it closed down. The flow of the place was a little off. I ordered at the counter and than waited for a table to open. By the time a table opened then we got our appetizer and pizza at the same time. Since it was garlic knots, it wasn't a big deal. However, the knots tasted pre-made and luke warm. I wouldn't order them again. They're way better at Five Points in East Nashville. This is a local place though so I'd visit again after they've been open for a bit and gotten things flowing a little better. It is nice to not have to drive as far for good pizza. Also, the iced tea was out, so they should check it more often, especially on busy nights.",1
"I came here with a colleague of mine for lunch and we were both indecisive about what we wanted to eat. Our choices were limited to what was within walking distance to work, and I actually felt like I wanted a pizza, but we were worried that pizzas would take too long. I had never been to Qdoba before, I had seen it on several occasions on drive-bys and at the airport, but I never had the urge to try it. My co-worker assured me that it was pretty much the same as Chipotle, and I would have to agree with her assessment. Although I think, Chipotle is slightly better? Not sure, I guess they are on par.

I guess Qdobo is the place to go if you want something really fast and easy to eat, that is not pizza, chinese fast food, taco bell, or other fast food drive throughs. The portions are also very large.  The burrito I got pretty much filled me up so that I didn't even eat dinner or breakfast the next day.",1
"The No. 1 gelato in the WORLD? In Philadelphia? You've gotta be kidding me.... 

As someone who has studied abroad in Italy, I was skeptical when my long-lost college friend and her fiance brought me to Capogiro.  But boy am I glad they took me here....I was dead wrong to question this place!

I'm usually a strawberry and chocolate kind of girl, so perusing the selection of flavors I was disappointed not to see a single berry flavor.  But then I caught a sign that said ""Avocado (trust us...)"", and being the avocado lover that I am, asked for a sample.  IT WAS AMAZEBALLS.  Seriously.  I ordered a small cone with Avocado & Nutella (you can never go wrong with nutella anything), and I can hands down say that this was the best gelato I've ever had. Creamy, smooth, and packed with refreshing flavor :)

Only complaint is that a small cone costs $5....for a poor med student, it's a steep price for some sweet indulgence!",1
"Got into Santa Barbara and went here for some drinks. Was a little disappointed they close so early, so we didn't get a chance to order any flights of beer or wine but did get to have beer from the bottle which wasn't bad. Would love to come back here earlier in time to taste everything else on their menu",-1
"Someone is ""salting"" this place ... what I mean is, if you are giving this joint even the sightest positive nod you are either a family member of the owner or you have been living in the Sudan for the last ten years (no offense to the Sudanese but if you have been there.. ) This restaurant was good years ago .. NOW = Old food that does not get replentished unless you beg (where the F is the board of health?) My wife goes for the Crab Legs (ALL YOU CAN EAT MY EYE) .. they actually have the nerve to post a hand written sign taped over the very small cab leg pan that reads ""please take only 3 or 4 legs ..be considerate to others"" What it should read is  ""Please take only 3 or 4 crab legs because we want to capture more of your money by not having to repentish the crab legs"" .... the propieters are very nice, but their actions are not appropriate .. Perhaps they should just close down and do something else .. or do something right.",-1
"It's bad. More breading than meat. Frozen Chinese food, it's a cookie cutter pop up Chinese restaurant.",-1
Bus over an hour late before I gave up. Call centers not open to get information until after 6 am even though they have busses running at 4:35 am. Would not give refund and use terms and conditions item 14 as a blanket clause to not give refund,-1
"Service was pretty bad.. Long wait between our app and our meal with no explanation...they dropped a spoon off once and left...about 30min later our dinner came.  Luke warm...and they dropped and ran no asking us if we wanted pepper or cheese like we heard them ask at the table next to us.  We complained and then had to explain what we didn't like to three people.  Very pretentious as other have said.  Waiter spilled wine two tables down from us.

Food was good...portions were medium sized.  The black spaghetti had a good amount of lobster in it.",-1
"It seriously pains me to be writing this update. I LOVED this Giant. Like, in an emotional way. And I still love that it's clean and has a lot of variety and great sale prices, so on and so forth and what have you. However, I'm sorry to say that I can no longer frequent this store due to its poor customer service. I don't know if they got a new manager or what, but in the past few months things there have gone seriously downhill. 

There are rarely people available to bag groceries, which in turn slows checkout lines while the cashier and customer both try to do it. More than once I've gotten in a line with a bagger only to have that person walk away after finishing up with a customer. 

In this same time period they have also gotten into the habit of stocking shelves during high traffic times - like Sunday's at 11. I get that items need to be on shelves, but I've seen them rearranging shelves during this time too - not necessary. It doesn't appear that they're just filling up on out of stock items - there are big carts and empty boxes in nearly every aisle at times. It causes so much traffic in the aisles and too many times you can't reach what you need. 

My biggest complaint is about the deli, though. One of my favorite things about this store is the ability to order your deli items from a kiosk, do all of your shopping, and then whip around and pick up your items - no need to grab a number and wait. This kiosk allows you to specify how you want your items sliced. I always choose Very Thin, and I used to get it. For several months now, however, my meat has been cut so thick that even my carnivore husband is grossed out by it. Yesterday I had enough and just left it there, going then to a different store for those items. 

I wish this store had maintained the high quality experience it had in the beginning, but unfortunately it hasn't and as a result, it's former biggest fan will be shopping elsewhere.",-1
"Popular venue because of location and association to Guy Harvey brand name. Food was below average, drinks uneventful, place smells like it could use a revamp, menus were dirty and sticky. Will not recommend.",-1
"If I was judging the food and menu, I'd say 4 stars - overall experience though was 3 stars -- which is still good but they have some things to improve.

This place is huge. It might even be too big. I entered from the mall side, got my pager, walked a distance to the restroom and my pager went off, I went back to where I had received the pager only to be told they seat from the front.  They led me through the very huge restaurant to the front - which was nice because I never would have found it on my own - and we were seated.  The menu was nice - good options, the waitress was helpful and recommended a beer.  One person brought the beer, someone else brought the other drink, then a third person brought our entrees. We didn't see our server again for quite some time - I imagine she was busy taking the long trek from her tables to the kitchen.  When we did see her she dropped off our bill - before we'd even finished eating.

People kept coming by asking if we were ""still picking"" at our fries.  I got the feeling we were supposed to eat and run even though there were other empty tables so we weren't camping during a busy hour.

So my final feeling is that it was good and I'll probably be back but I feel like they need better systems in place to deal with the size/number of tables.  For a two-top I felt like things were a little disorganized and rushed so I can only imagine how larger parties could feel.",-1
"The shrimp tacos and margaritas are reason enough to come.  I have a Local Taco next to my house (on Fatherland), but drive to this location because the cook is top notch.  The bartender explained that he tweaks some of the recipes, and it works!! Haven't had anything bad here.  The margarita mix is made in-house, and you can tell.  It is super fresh.  Don't even bother getting a top shelf margarita, the house is that good.",1
"Not many places are willing to accommodate dogs that can't place nice with others. They give her special one on one playtime (or with her buddy when I had two that played well). 

Also very few places offer the extended hours, even weekends, and especially without charging for the entire day. Worth the extra price to know she's been attended to, not just fed and crated like at the vet.",1
"Yea! Another Chick-fil-A!

Just happened to be driving down (up?) Bloomingdale looking for a new spot to eat, and saw this. OK, it's not new food, but it is a new location (opened yesterday).

The parking lot is crazy, like many in FL, but the staff outside kept the drive-thru lanes flowing. I was in line for less than ten minutes. *Every* last employee I talked to, and I talked to six, were pleasant and welcoming, just like every Chick-fil-A I've ever been to.

The food was good of course, although the fries could have been cooked a bit longer. Chick-fil-A sandwhcih was on poojnt, and so was the sweet tea.

Welcome to Bloomingdale CFA!",1
"Came in with 45 mins to spare, employees were cleaning everything up and gave us complete attitude. All that was left was couscous and chicken shawarma. Completely bummed, I've heard such great things from coworkers about this place. Ended up going to Wawa because we were starving.",-1
"I was recently in an accident where someone hit the passenger side of my car, and with my car being a lease I was paranoid and super frustrated. However, Ken, Service Manager, helped alleviate my worries. From when I first called first thing in the morning following the accident up until I picked up my car from being repaired a week later I had nothing but pleasant exchanges with him. Ken walked me through each and every step and made me feel comfortable with the work that was going to be done, as well as provided the lowest quote as compared to the other body shops I checked out.  I would definitely recommend Ken and his team not only because they completed the work in a timely fashion, but also because their communication and follow through was super helpful in a very stressful situation.",1
"This was my first Ethopian food experience. Although I have nothing to compare it to, I will say it was a wonderful introduction. The host and servers were very welcoming and explained the history of Ethopian food, the restaurant itself and our choosen entrees in detail. The dishes themselves were fresh and flavorful as well. I look forward to trying more Ethopian and other African cuisine in the future",1
"Best sushi I have ever had, in my life. One of my favorite restaurants. This sushi is what dreams are made of!! The rolls and sauces are so unique and taste amazing. They are on the pricier side compared to your average sushi restaurant, but not by much. We are talking a $1-$3 increase per roll at Sakana. That few dollars is well worth the quality, taste, and experience a million times over. The rolls at Sakana are larger and more full of fish as well, so I get full faster. I cannot rave enough about this place. There's sometimes a long wait, because it is a small restaurant but it is worth it. Try going right at opening (5:00 on weekends) to be sat right away. Also- Merry Go Round Roll. You won't be disappointed.",1
"This place is alright.  Pretty soon it will  be the top chinese food around, because everywhere else is closing.  I've seen the quality decline over the years, but I'd still give this place a chance.  It's good enough?",1
"I went here with a group of friends during Restaurant Week and it was the complete opposite from what we were expecting. We heard that it was the best crab in Philadelphia, so why wouldn't we want to try it? As one of the guys put it, we felt like we were at ""Bingo Night"" as soon as we walked in. No big deal tho, we had an 8pm reservation and the nine of us arrived about ten minutes early, knowing we would most likely have to wait a little. Nothing prepared us for the 45 minutes of waiting that we ended up standing through. The boys were fine, they went to the bar and made friends with what seemed to be like a regular crowd. When we were finally seated and all decided on our dishes (thank goodness), our server began The Countdown. I have never experienced this before but with every course or round of drinks he would come over and tell us ""Okay guys, about 7 more minutes"" then return a few minutes later and say ""Alright well we have about 3 more minutes left"" and as annoying as it was, he made us all laugh. So it was fine. I ordered the RW special that was salmon stuffed with a crab cake, and it was okay. I would have been fine if the food were on par with a 45 minute wait but it just was not worth it. The best part of the entire experience was the store bought chocolate cake we had for dessert, as they vacuumed around us.",-1
"Went in for gel manicure and regular pedicure. I had a Groupon deal - first of all, they said I couldn't avail that without an appointment, which is just rude!
Secondly, there were only 2 women who work here and when we went in with 2 mani pedis and 1 mani, they made it sound like we would get done in no time, but made us wait forever!
One of them was constantly on her phone or going outside repeatedly.
I would give it one more star if at least the quality was good - but the gel mani came off in a week. 
Would NOT recommend.",-1
"Having lived close by this location in my college years, I have a fondness to this Starbucks because of the memories, and will still stop by if I'm in the area. They have a decent drive-thru, and they make my latte right. 

Apparently Starbucks has updated their oatmeal to stone rolled oats that aren't quite as good and the baristas are still working out the water ratio. My oatmeal was extremely watery on my last visit, and I tried to bring it back but the barista told me he put in the right amount, but I had to wait 5 minutes... OK, it had been at least 4 minutes, but to give him the benefit of the doubt  I waited another 5 minutes... still extremely watery.

I get that it's new, but I wish he would have just gotten me a new one instead of making me wait another 5 minutes. Oh well, my coffee was still good and I'll be back if I'm close by!",-1
"Food here is mediocre to good, depending on the day, and what you order.
 I take my (now adult) kids here from time to time. It is a BYOB which I like. I have not been disappointed by anything I have ever gotten here, except the seafood platter, which was over cooked.
My daughter got the chicken marsala. Unfortunately she compares it to mine (and mine is very tasty). The marsala sauce was tasty, but the chicken had a very thick coating of flour. This gave a a sticky, doughy texture to the dish. I think the flavor overall is good, but they need to skip the thick coating, and just dust the chicken to make it have a brown crispy coating.
I had the grilled salmon. It was tasty. And I liked the grilled broccoli. It gives it a better taste, and it was not over cooked.
3 stars. it is usually good, but not Wow.
And I'll be back.",1
"As far as car buying experiences go this was one of the better ones but still not stellar. We went to purchase a new Jeep for my wife and the salesman Bruce was a pleasure to deal with and put some extra effort into trying to process some rebates we weren't sure about to see if we could still qualify and was really trying to go the extra mile for us . The new Jeep was to our liking but they couldn't meet our price so we left to have lunch nearby and the phone tag game started. Finally they met our price on one and we returned. They didn't have porters or runners so our (older) salesman had to retrieve each vehicle that we looked at himself from the frozen lot and he was running himself ragged and we actually felt a bit bad for him and he also had to leave the premises to drive down to their other dealership himself to bring down the one we ultimately purchased . That took up a lot of time and we spend way more time just waiting around than we would have liked. Lastly some vehicles had spare donut tires and some didn't even though it wasn't disclosed on the sticker so we had to wait for a spare to be retrieved to put into our vehicle before we finished signing away the final documents . All in all it worked out in the end and we were extremely pleased w the brand new Cherokee and the deal but just wished it all went a little faster. In the end money talks and BS walks and they got us to the deal we were looking for . Also have to say the manager Alphie stepped in and immediately made a couple things right for us when we did have some concerns that would have stalled the deal and we were pleased with that. I would definitely consider buying another vehicle from them again going forward.  

On a side note: The Internet ads all show a sale price for each new vehicle but in actuality they include extra rebates that most people won't ever qualify for , just to lure you in for that price then let you down . It would make it so much easier if they just disclosed all that upfront in an understandable way to break it all down, so it would make the process that much less aggravating .",1
"Old City, Philly PA
Came here once, it was a Monday night spot for karaoke! Wasn't too crowded, not too many singers initially. Yayyyyyy no lines. Appetizers ok. Im a non alcoholic so I have my usual: sprite with cherries, ( I need to think up a new non-alcoholic drink this summer when I go karaoke hopping more  because it is getting boring.) I have to admit I liked it here than some places Ive been for karaoke, for no reason at all. ;-) Slowly, one at a time, I remember all the places I've been as they show up while Im yelp-surfing. I don't remember bar names too well, if you ask me if Ive been to Rotten Ralph's, I'd tell you: never heard of it! Haha.",1

"Fantastic! My favorite way to start a vacation in a new city. Bring cash, because you will WANT to tip the guide well by the end.",1
"Didn't care for this place. We shared the big easy breakfast and it was okay. The food was barely warm, and the whole meal was eh except for the pancakes. The pancakes were good, would've tasted better if they were warmer.  The hot chocolate was good, thick chocolate, and it came in a to-go cup which was convenient. The service was also good. We arrived on a Friday morning around 8:15 am and there was no wait, but it was starting to fill up. By the time we left there were a few people waiting outside.",1
"Pretty slow service and the waitresses aren't very kind. I guess I was expecting something different at a diner with high ratings but I understand it's in the middle of a tourist area. However, service should be a priority. Something that really bothered me was how much trash was left on the floor of the outside deck- it all has the potential to blow right into the ocean. NOT OKAY. I had to stand up several times to grab straw wrappers and napkins before they blew into the water. If you're going to have a waterfront/beach front business, be responsible about it. It would be a very easy fix-just a screen on the bottom of the fence. The food was good but I won't be back.",-1
"I'm a partner so I know the standards and I'm usually pretty understanding since I know what it's like. But the minute I walked into the store the girl on bar had an attitude with another customer. The store wasn't busy and I was the only one waiting, the Barista at the register didn't acknowledge me. I probably waited a good couple minutes before being greeted. The guy didn't give me my discount after I told him I was a partner.... luckily I mobile ordered my other drinks. Even then I didn't even drink my caramel macchiato because it was gross.",-1
Great location but it seems as though they've already turned into a nicer version of hooters. Too many guys and too many bartenders that no drink making skills but look great. Wish they would've made it more like the Miami version. Bathrooms are a miss being so small for a place that large.,1
"We drive 30min roundtrip when there are 8 Chinese restaurants within 2 miles of our home and several that will deliver.

We stumbled on this one late at night. Have not eaten at the restaurant but use CARRYOUT and it is now without a doubt the only place we will go get carry out Chinese on the east side of Indy. 

We've had the Mongolian Beef, the Beef Kung Pow, the Beef Chow Mei Fun several times (3 meals in a box), their Chicken on a Stick is the BEST (get 2, you'll want them later), the Nicest Crab Rangoon flavor we've had any where in Indiana.",1

 only thing here worth traveling for is the different beers on tap and good conversation


In response to the GM who responded to my review

it's impressive you stand by your staff

But my opinion is my opinion. and I stand by what I wrote... I took shots at no one

But your request that I stay away, will be honored!

"I travel to Boise at least once a month, if not more.
The fact that you have to hit the counter instead of walking out and popping into a car is kind of annoying, but not too terribly out of the way (bottom of the escalators on the way outside)

Staff has been friendly and helpful to me on each occasion. Once i had to grab the car instead of a co-worker due to a delayed flight, they were able to switch the reservation etc. with no problem.

The signing of the no damage slip is only if you have not reserved on line or ahead of time, and it was indicated to me that i could circle any issues and tell the staff at the booth before i left. Definitely weird, but it all worked out for me, so far.

Drop off has always been a breeze, but i head out around noon and always bring the workers a treat! (i have to stop at taco time for the hubby and that location always gives me cinnamon chips - so i leave it for the little fellas that have to be out in the cold collecting my car, it's the least i can do!)

It is a small operation at a small airport, and i think they do ok in my book!",1
"Second night in a row at 2 Different LaQuintas, both times I am questioning whether the room has been cleaned properly, coffee stains and cup rings at one, and when I opened the door on the second, a piece of the heating/AC unit laying on the floor on one side of the bed and a empty to go cup on the other....needless to say, extremely disappointed",-1
"I'm not particularly a fan of the Century Hospitality restaurants and I hadn't been to a Deluxe BB location in a few years so I decided to give it another shot the other week. 

The atmosphere is cool but when you bite into the burger it is such a let down. Their overpriced burgers (and sides) are so disappointing that it brings tears to my eyes. Nobody in my party enjoyed their eats and nobody would come back. 

The burgers sounds delicious from the description but in reality they are boring, dry, and void of any sort of flavor. I don't know how the Century Group can keep these locations afloat let alone keep expanding. 

It's really not that hard to make even a decent burger and somehow Deluxe Burger Bar fails. DO NOT GO.",-1
"So it's 6:30 pm and all flights at the airport are delayed due to weather. This pizza place is right in the middle of the terminal so it's a good place to grab a bite. Here's the problem. They have no food! I ordered a salad and was told ""we are all out of salads"", then I ordered a slice of margarita pizza and was told that all that is available is pepperoni or cheese. The lady behind me wanted garlic knots, they were out. The place was empty at first so it's not like they sold out. They just didn't stock well. They have one kid working there and he makes one pizza at a time. Don't have a menu up if only 2 of the 11 items are offered! The pizza was fine but it was really a strange experience.",-1
"There's honestly nothing wrong with Famous Dave's and some people really like it... to me, it's not worth writing home about. (I went to a rehearsal dinner here last weekend) There were those big ""garbage pail lid"" platters all over with brisket, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, corn muffins, baked beans & cole slaw. I found the brisket and pulled pork to be a little dry... but there are lots of sauces at the table so you can slather it up if that's your thing. This may sound strange but my favorite parts of the meal were the cole slaw, baked beans & the bread pudding for dessert. 

Service: Keep in mind I was there with a BIG group but.. our waiter seemed pretty overwhelmed, poor guy!

Tip: Don't waste your time with the margaritas - VERY sweet, not much tequila flavor at all.",-1
"I went there for the first time on Tuesday.  The pain in my shoulders and neck diminished 80% by the next day and I also slept for 9 hours that night!  
The tables were also really comfortable:)",1
"So my cat Dr. Tinkles had the yowls and I just had to get out of the house for a spell. Walking the streets of uptown it began to rain and I soon found myself seeking refuge in the confines of one New York Pizza (in New Orleans! Don't these folks know how we southerners feel about carpet bagging types?!)

Anyway, I forgave the cultural transgression the moment the lively bar staff opened their arms to me. I believe one was named Iggy and I immediately took to her as she obviously cared for cats as well, she talked about hers quite a bit and even sang a ditty about him (though I must confess I think naming your cat simply ""pussy"" is a bit of a copout).

The other waitstaff were a calming influence as well (even though some sported ""ink"" which I personally find to be of low class, but some of their crudely doodled images did make me giggle and a pregnant employee gave one heck of a backrub).
Enough about the service (a mix of moxie, puckishness, and downright questionability) how was the food? I ordered something called a pizza pie with pepperoni. It was a circular dough based concoction with red sauce, cheese, and discs of the aforementioned meat topping. And it was tasty. Flaky, buttery crust. Cheesy, chewy goodness and the pepperoni? Don't take my word for it but I think this combination could really catch on with the go go kids of today!

In addition they plied with me seven different beers on draft (all good save for something called tin roof which tasted like, well, a tin roof), five well poured jack Daniels, a complimentary car bomb, and several ""mystery shots"" one of which I think contained Spanish fly.

Six hours, and several disastrous rounds of ""shake a shake"" later, I left well fed, well tended, and danced out. Good food, great times and leftovers for Dr. Tinkles.

Addendum: The leftover pizza pie caused Dr. Tinkles to stop his yowling (and pretty much all other biological functions. RIP Dr. Tinkles)",1
"Not a great first experience at Pastorcito. 

I had three tacos - two pastor and one asada, they were all very underwhelming. The pastor was bland and there was very little meat in the filling, it was mainly made up of fat. The asada was a bit better in that it wasn't just fat. But it still lacked flavor. The saving grace of this place was its salsa. The red one was petty good and if you drench your tacos it's hard to taste the crapiness underneath.

Tacos were 1.85, which puts is a bit more than anyone should pay for below average tacos. You can find much better tacos for 1.50 or less at many other places.",-1
"HUGE disappointment!  I am from Seattle and came down to Santa Barbara for New Year's Eve.  My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews, got a recommendation from a local, and thought the online menu looked good.

When I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

My girlfriends and I got dressed up, made our way to the restaurant, and the second we walked in, I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful), and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant, surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The ""Latin jazz"" band was little more than forgettable background music, which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy, the wait staff were professional, but not personable, and the food was incredibly disappointing.

We knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing, and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served, the wait staff, highly attentive, perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back, not many people were there, and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers, which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes, but perhaps this was better, because the food was absolutely terrible.

I can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe, and apparently there was a guest chef that night, but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way, but to serve it on a plate, with sides on the outside of the tin foil, made no sense to me.  In the end, it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.

We ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland, vibe-less, and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights, but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others.",-1
The food is okay sometimes. The Mexican style food isn't that good but the BBQ stuff here is actually pretty decent. Two stars because one of the people in our party sucked up a fake eyelash in her straw from the water she was served in and was only given a free drink as a sorry. Thought she would've deserved something a little better considering how disgusting it would be to suck up a big fake eyelash... will not be going back here.,-1
"i enjoyed the pizza and apps, but just thought the service was way too slow.  i felt like i was sitting around waiting for something the whole time i was there.  for a pizza that's supposed to be cooked in around 3 minutes, why the long wait times?  that being said, when the pizza finally did come out, it was pretty tasty, albeit very greasy.  i'm chalking the grease up to the type of pizza i ordered, as the other pizza at the table was delicious.",1
"The wines were very good, and the view is incredible! FYI, no food here - just a small cheese plate, which was very nice to have while enjoying a wine flight. Unfortunately, the one worker was pathetic - a young man who clearly had no motivation to work. When we asked about the wines, all he would say is the name and the year, then plop the bottle in front of us so we could read it ourselves. He was honestly quite rude, as if we were inconveniencing him. The other lady working gave us very nice descriptions of each wine - we were very happy when she helped us out instead!
I recommend going - it is so relaxing with a wonderful view - but please ask one of the girls to help you out!",1
"We went on a Saturday and it was ""sold out"". It was crowded to the point of being dangerous especially in the little kid sections. I could not imagine that they didn't go over their legal occupancy and that it wasn't a health hazard. We had all-day tickets but left early because we couldn't take it anymore...hour-long lines for the few attractions they have; 45-minute waits for the changing rooms and bathrooms. And the tickets are so cheap compared to other water parks because the food is ASTRONOMICALLY priced...NINE CHICKEN NUGGETS and a bucket of fries for THIRTY DOLLARS!!! Never again!",-1
"I miss Mexically, but if you can't make the trek/wait in line for Don Memos then this is a decent option.  Most recently I had the chicken tostada.  It was a ton of food, but it didn't wow me.  The flavors are kind of bland.  I wish they didn't charge for guacamole.  It's cheap, quick Mexican style food.",1
"The last 2 times we took our dog here, our female dog got kennel cough.  Added vet bills over $100.  Never going back to this place again.",-1
"Pretty average breakfast place. Much of the menu is an exact replica of Coras which is kind of boring.

First off, one of the main reasons why I gave a low rating is because of the coffee. If you want to be a breakfast/lunch ONLY restaurant, you'd better have some killer coffee. The coffee here tasted like watery Folgers.

For food, we ordered the Celine's Special and the Steak and Mushroom Eggs Benedict.

Both were cooked well. Celine's special was mostly typical breakfast food so basic, but done well.
I was expecting actual pieces of STEAK with the benedict, but it was shaved Philly steak type meat. I asked for soft poached eggs and that was exactly what I got. The hollandaise with the Benedict was pretty bland though.

The potatoes that came with each meal would be better if crispier and not soggy/floppy. They were also a little salty.

This restaurant wasn't terrible, but not nearly as good as Haps which is not far away. The service here also left something to be desired...

But ultimately, it was THE COFFEE that really made for a very sub-par experience.",1
"My experience with this particular store was... *sigh, eye roll* I felt uncomfortable from the time I left my car to checking out. I was stared at the entire time; maybe I was turning colors going from aisle to aisle, idk lmaooo. However, I retrieved the item I came for. The cashier at self-checkout was nice, though. And would you know, she spoke, too! lol. It takes one positive moment to outweigh every other trivial thing. 

Thank God there are way more locations with great customer service and better stocked stores. And girl, my Amex will go where I'm accepted and celebrated...OK?! So, don't worry. The revolution won't be televised in the frozen fruit section. I'm good. I won't be back.

BUT: this is was Oakville. I acknowledged where I was, and I know what it is.",-1
"The deals that are offered at Ninki are great (who wouldn't want 50% off sushi rolls!), but the actual sushi isn't that great. My sushi was very bland and had no taste to it. I tried some of the fried rice from my husband's bento box and it was bland as well! The only thing I liked was their gyoza...now that was good!

Probably won't be returning here anytime soon.",-1

"I could just copy and paste the majority of the reviews into this box, but I guess I will share my experience first hand.

At first, I thought it was a farmers market. I texted my friend asking her what time we should go so I knew when to cook dinner and she told me to hold off dinner - I was going to get stuffed at this event.

She was dead wrong.

When we arrived around 7:30 we found it super packed. Long long times, tight crowds, lots of dogs and babies. We circled the event trying to pick out which line we were going to devote our entire night to standing in, and decided on the Jamaican truck. After an hour of standing in line, and having other line go-ers friends casually jip us, we finally made it to the front to order only to have the vendor announce they were out of all of my meal options.

So you know what I had for dinner the evening of Night Market? A bag of chips from CVS.

This event had it's potential. But I guess they were not counting on the ridiculous horde of hungry people. Most trucks were placing ""SOLD OUT"" signs just as we were arriving. There were very few vegetarian/vegan options... (actually, don't believe any food vendors had vegan options). Hopefully next time they will be able to work out their kinks.",-1

"It gets three stars because the salsa was delicious (that is how I judge a mexican restaurant) and the guac was definitely fresh but a bit over priced in my opinion. As a vegetarian there are not many options on the menu and I avoided the rice and beans just to be on the safe side.  The waitress and the folks I spoke to on the phone were a bit confused when I asked if the beans and rice were vegetarian so it was better to be safe than sorry.  I was able to sub mexican corn or fresh veggies which was a nice option to have.  Shoulda gone for the veggies as it was just plain, bland corn.  My entree was cheese enchiladas and the portion was good sized for the price.  However the salsa verde was a total disappointment.  Not really flavorful at all.  Ahh California how I miss you and your riches of yummy Mexican food!",-1
The barbers here will make you look TOO good. I'm not even joking. I got a haircut and shave yesterday and today I'm getting smiles and hellos from women walking past. I'm not used to this at all. I swear I've never looked this good in my life. In my opinion anyway. My barber was Katie. She really took care of me.,1
"This is easily located off on rt 30, great location. 

I order the chicken cheese steak and wings. The cheese steak was great, well cooked and cheesy. The wings weren't what I expected, they were breaded wings. The breading on he wings didn't really have a flavor, in my opinion I think they should have listed that the wings were breaded. Added a little hot sauce to give some flavor. 

I've had there pizza before and was great! 

They do offer a selection of takeout beer. 

They do take cash, credit or apple pay :)",1
"Granted they got me my prism film for my glasses, and I went through a different optometrist for the frame. I brought my glasses in. The woman assisting me had me put the film on to measure it. Got that cleared up. Then she comes back 10 minutes later to tell me all done and it will be $35. Not bad price... but when she cut it she didn't bother to tell me she didn't cut them to actually fit my whole frame. 

I showed her how she cut them incorrectly, and they look shattered on the sides bc of her cut job. Please do not make me pay for something and have it look like I can't afford a proper lense bc you felt like not doing your job properly.

"Well its not the Magazine st location for sure. I had the smoked salmon, shrimp rolls and calamari.

"I was really impressed when I went to Nashville Humane. I expected some grubby run down building with nasty old rusty cages full of desperate dogs and cats. 

What I found instead was a clean, big, new facility. In the lobby, there are the pets of the week, who have a special reduced adoption fee of $35, and that includes spay/neuter and all shots.

I went because I was inquiring about their Rover truck, which goes around Nashville and spay/neuters dogs and cats for only $10. I had just been adopted by a tomcat who was trying to make everything in my house his (i.e. peeing all over it). The staff were so helpful and even though they were fully booked up and I had to go elsewhere, they followed up and called me two weeks later when they had a spot.

"health food overload. this place looks and smells like the prototypical health food store, which i do not dig. (call me what you will, but i like my health food disguised in pretty environs like whole foods. if i'm going to pay top dollar, i don't want to feel like i've walked into a feed store.)

there are lots of products for lots of special needs; however, i found that some things were more expensive than the nearby whole foods so unless i absolutely need something that only essene has, i'll likely not return.",-1
"Salsa is absolutely terrible. Chips are great, but man that salsa lacks any and all flavor. No salt in it, no spice, no heat. The sweet potato and pork nachos were okay. It seems like a place that's overpriced and terrible because it can be due to its location. Up your salsa game. 


******************UPDATE***********************

So I went into their location on oak street after a fun night out with my buddy and I told him ""let's just go see if their salsa is any different than the other location. Plus, it was Endymion that night, so who knows. Everyone deserves a second chance.""

We sit down at the bar and my buddy goes to use the restroom. Bartender asks me if we're eating, drinking, or a little of both. I told him about my previous salsa experience and he nodded. Thinking nothing of it, I go to use the restroom after my bro comes out and upon my return I have the general manager, the owner (I think?), and a chef all gathered around me to have me try their new salsa! Apparently they recognized me from my yelp profile picture, and wanted to leave a better impression. Well they most certainly did. They did something that I'm not accustomed to seeing in restaurants: they cared. 

To veer off into a tiny tangent for a second, of all the restaurants I go to, good food is usually just a percentage or part of the overall experience. You won't go into an Applebee's or Chili's expecting to be taken care of. You go in there, you lock eyes with your waiter's tired eyes, you know everything is nuked in the microwave, you order it anyways, you eat, you pay, you tip, you leave. Don't expect anything magical from Applebee's or Chili's. They don't care. It's a mechanical process that's specialized by corporate heads in nicer places to delude you into thinking you're getting great service, or at least are entitled to, but you're not. You know that. But that's now why you go there. But that's the difference between those chain restaurants and restaurants that care. So to bring my tangent back to my main point, La Casita definitely left a lasting impression on me by showing how much they care. And that's what you want in a restaurant. 

They changed their salsa and I got to try it. Now to be honest, fair, and balanced I didn't like their new salsa either. But if you're going based off of flavor, it was a thousand times better than what I experienced previously. I've worked at a Mexican restaurant where they made their salsa in house, and my tastebuds can't speak for everyone as everyone has specific things they like and dislike. I just happen to like salsa with a bit more heat, tang, and pop. But their salsa is definitely unique and improved.

Have not had an opportune chance to sit down and dine there yet, but will as soon as I can find some time! If you're in the mood for ""Tex mex meets Southern California with an authentic Mexican twist"" as the bartender described it, then definitely head down there and be greeted by people who want you to enjoy your experience not because they're getting paid to but, rather more importantly, because they care.",-1

"Stay anywhere but here! They got so little right during our three night stay. Staff not at all helpful during check in when our prepaid rooms had been reassigned to other guests. Maids were the noisiest we've heard in the mornings, playing TV loud with doors open while cleaning, joking around in the hallways in front of doors with Do Not Disturb signs. They actually were whistling loudly up and down the hallway in order to wake the guests!They made up the beds without straightening the bottom sheets. A child could do a better job of making a bed. The elevators smelled, noisy AC units, tiny bathrooms -- we even had to ask for water glasses for our rooms. From what I hear, all this is typical of a Hyatt Place. We won't be staying at one again.",-1

"I was technically a member at this gym from February of 2012 until this past February, though I stopped going months before that point.

When I signed up, I had great intentions of working out all of the time, but then my workload increased (okay, I AM listing off excuses, but whatever) and my back started hurting horribly to the point that I was having trouble walking (turns out I do have diagnosed back issues now.) I went in looking to cancel my contract -- thinking I just had to give two months notice. I had no idea upon signing the contract in February that it was a year-long commitment. It just wasn't made clear.

I ended up paying a bulk price at once to cover my membership without debits each month on my bank account, but that honestly still peeves me a little when I think of Retro. I just think contracts should be made more clear up front.

Otherwise, it's a pretty decent gym. $19.99/month, but they have some random bi-yearly charges, too, which would spike up the per month price if you really think about it. The bathrooms were clean and the machines were nice. I was always one of those girls who would go in the movie theater area - a nice perk.

Now if my boyfriend was the one writing this review, it would have 10 stars up top. He is there whenever he has a free second!",1
"For some reason I end up at this Wal Mart when they first open around 6:30. As I enter the employees are still stocking shelves and arriving for work. I head to the water section and pick up a case for work and head to the only check out that is open. 

This whole process only takes about 10 minutes. This seems to be the best time to shop at Wal Mart, otherwise it it jam packed with people.

One note; every time I go to this Wal Mart, the employees stare at me while I go to get my water. It is if I am an Alien sent to observe the Wal Mart workers. My guess is I am the only person crazy enough to go water shopping at 6:30 in the morning.",1
Can never go wrong with this old favorite! Just got a free milkshake because I ordered large fries and a large drink I Love it!,1
"We stayed at peddlers village for a wedding.  Decided we liked the looks of Earl's. We went in just as lunch was ending, but before dinner. We were told we could make a reservation for 30 minutes later and come back.  A little strange we thought. The woman at the desk seems to think she is the gate keeper. Much like the soup Nazi. Lol. We returned as instructed and waited with six other groups for the clock to read precisely 5pm.  At 5pm she asked who had reservations (even with the restaurant empty) and sat us all in order of reservations then non reservations...she made a very loud general announcement to this effect. We all chuckled amongst ourselves. Oh and the food was ""good"".",1
"The sandwiches tasted good, but when trying to complete the kids meal for my 2 girls it was chaos. First when I asked for the apples and milk the girl tried to charge me extra for them, then after arguing with her she directed me to the refrigerator unit to help myself. There was only one bag of apples and they were moldy. It took over 5 minutes to get 2 fresh bags. Near the end of our meal my girls, after drinking almost all of the milk said that it tasted funny. I looked at the expiration day and it had expired two weeks prior. I told the uninterested worker and we left. Thankfully my kids didn't get sick. I wouldn't go back to that particular restaurant, but I still like Subway.",-1
"Since I don't live in Reno (I live in Las Vegas), I didn't know anything about the concert venues up there. I heard a radio commercial & picked up tickets to the Halestorm (preceeded by Eve to Adam & In This Moment) show a couple weeks ago while I was up there. So, for the good & bad...
Venue floorplan is HORRIBLE! It's long and narrow, which means the majority of attendees cannot even get a glimpse of the stage. I know I don't go to concerts to watch it on a tiny little TV screen. The first floor is so crowded that once in the door, it was a bear trying to get to the bar. The bartenders were so rude, too! The Over-21 lounge upstairs looked nice. But, again, good luck trying to see anything.  I was lucky, though. There was a small group that went together & a couple of them let me wiggle up to the rail so I could see the bands play a few songs. The bar and bartenders up there were great! Not knowing the area, it took me forever to find a place to park. I ended up at a casino parking garage a few blocks away. I wasn't impressed that the entrance was in an alley. But, the will call lady was really nice. I really enjoy the more intimate venues, but this place was not for me.",1
"This place is just awful. Great atmosphere, but food is just plain bad. I've given it too many tries. Done.",1
"I went here based off of reviews... the place was not bad- but I went in expecting more. I think a 3 star review is appropriate based off of the meal I had... which was a skillet so potatoes, sausage , eggs, tomatoes, cheese with a muffin and a side of grits...pretty simple--  so maybe the other reviews were based off of specialties...",1
"Service is not their strong point.  The hostess actually walked away from me when she saw me coming over to be seated so that she could get a glass of water for an existing table.  There were only 4 tables in the entire place.... 

It took the waiter about twice as long as it should have to get to my table.  He was very personable and helpful when i ordered.... but it took way too long for him to get my food or to check on me for the rest of the night.  It wouldn't have been a problem if he had been overly busy, but like i said... there were only 4 tables.... and he wasn't the only waiter.

The food was good, but on the pricey side.  I had the crayfish bisque which was delicious, and the crayfish etouffe.  In retrospect, i should have ordered something other than crayfish.  It was good, but i kinda overdosed on crayfish.

I like the atmosphere, but the chairs are very uncomfortable. 

With the frustration of waiting, and the fact that they are a bit on the high side for price, i wouldn't go back unless no other choices were convenient.",-1
"Local Casino gets points for not making me fly to Vegas or Atlantic City to gamble.

that being said the casino is a bit small on the gambling floor side of things, only a tiny bit of tables and it's hard to find a penny slot machine.  

I play penny slots more for entertainment than to win anything, if I'm looking to make money I'll play blackjack.

the restaurant selection is weak though, the Rise is flavorless and lackluster.  I have yet to try this particular Hard Rock Cafe but I have been to others and I can't imagine it's much different.",-1
Why this place is so awesome I have no idea. Chili cheese etoufee with extra bread is the way to do it. Wanna mix it up? Get a half a half with chili cheese etoufee and something else. No idea why the one in Bloomington is called Dats now.,1
Dirty rooms & headboard trash under the bed. alarm clock and radio doesn't work. unknown substance on curtains in the room appears to be someone's DNA. absolutely no benefit to the concierge level not allowed access to the club or library. Hallways and elevator  look like they haven't been cleaned since it was the PSFS building. incompetent Front house staff that are unhelpful unwilling and unknowledgeable to accommodate adequate service,-1
"Franklin Nails gave me the best mani/pedi I've had in a long time.  Now a days I feel rushed at nail salons, and if I want a relaxing experience I've had to pay for it. Not here. With a gel manicure and pedicure, I was there for over an hour and a half. They really took their time. One week later, and both mani and pedi are going strong. So reasonably priced too! I'll be back!",1
"Walked in and sat at the sushi bar. I told the chefs my budget and what kind of fish I liked. They created 2 of the most delicious rolls I've ever had and I think they had fun doing it. ""Colorful roll"" and a version of their ""Big Yami"" pictured below.",1
"We shop at acme pretty frequently. Today, we accidentally left a bag with a good amount of food in it at the self check out (pasta salad, cheese, etc). We noticed the moment we got home and immediately returned to the store. I also tried calling customer service twice to let them know and it just rang, and rang, and rang with no answer. 

Well, when we got back - they were already reshelving our items! My husband had to go around the store and track everything down. 

Are you freaking kidding me? You're telling me that they don't even wait for people to return before putting PURCHASED items back to sell AGAIN? There's seriously not a location where they put these items to give the buyers a chance to return?! 

It was honestly a span of 20 minutes. That's ridiculous.",-1
"horrible. in Everyway. coffee
and food
taste horrible. horrible service too. Hat trick of horrible. NO STARS.",-1
"Let me be frank and say I am a universal Schlafly fan. I like the Schlafly family, their products, each restaurant, and their presence in the St. Louis community. This review is based on several experiences. 

Bottleworks: Great beer and a nice atmosphere. You can bring your entire family, a group to watch the game or have a quiet date night spot. Food is of great quality and nice quantity. 

Waitstaff are some of the best in the City. I have never ever been disappointed with a server, manager, buser or host. One time a buser overheard my dad talking about a particular beer that was no longer on tap for the season. My dad was bummed because he had just discovered it and wasn't able to find it anymore. 15 minutes later the young man dropped off a mini-pint at our table and told us he had looked and found a tiny reserve in the back. Super impressive and wayyy beyond the call of duty.",1
"Not at all impressed...dingy and not the cleanest.  I actually was scared to place my luggage anywhere near the floor.  I think this may have been former government housing.   Trying to figure out how it has the Marriott name.  I do have to say, the front desk people in addition to the breakfast ladies, were professional and polite.  The hotel is just in desperate need of renovation.",-1
"I will forever be disappointed as to how ""un-outlet"" this place truly is. Although, I've given this store EVERY opportunity when I've been in the market for new appliances, I have NEVER found this outlet to serve my needs and my budget accordingly nor honestly. 
The pricing is foolish. For example, two identical refrigerators; one marked ""returned"" and one clearly damaged were priced exactly the same as the NEW unit I saw in Sears proper at the Deptford Mall three days prior. The posted ""Yellow Tag Clearance Event"" is fraudulent. 
I can only surmise that people that do buy here are just lazy. Perception of value is more important than reality in retail. So be it. After nearly 10 attempts to shop here, I am done.",-1
I have eaten here several times over the years and have noticed some inconsistencies. The first 3-4 times I ate there I considered it one of the best things I've eaten (though that could be because I was hammered). Typically there is an older Greek-looking gentleman working (I'm assuming the owner) and he is pleasant and prepares the gyros well. The last trip we made however was a disappointment. There was a younger man working who seemed pissed off and literally threw our food together. The meat/vegetables didn't seem as fresh and we were a little let down after going straight for the gyros after an 8 hour drive. I will be returning again this spring for another chance and am hoping for redemption. Also - they only take cash so come prepared!,-1
"Yes yes yes, I will review this place once i've actually eaten here! 

But, I just wanted to say that it's not the greatest place to grab a slice for takeout. Although there are tables and chairs outside on the sidewalk (nice touch), it's more of a sit-down place. There is a bar to chill out and have a beer while you wait, but since it was packed we didn't want to stand awkwardly next to a table and wait for a slice to come out. 
Interior is nice. I appreciate how clean and well-kept it looks.
I think the fact that this place is busy means it must be doing something right. However, the wait staff we talked to was very awkward, not helpful, and made me want to run out of there. So, I did.",-1
So disappointed...pho broth was just ok and they really skimped out on the beef brisket. My husband's bahn mi pork sandwich was mostly bread again with very little meat. We've had much better bahn mi and pho in Philly/NY/NJ area and were excited to try the local Vietnamese influence. Sadly did not live up to the hype.,-1
"An okay hotel. 

Cons: Our room was in the northeast corner every morning (we were there for about a week) around 6am I would be woken up by a truck backing up. Our TP holder would not stay attached to the wall and it took several calls to the front desk to get maintenance up to fix it. A friend had a clogged bathtub drain and it was only partially cleared by the end of the trip.

Pros: Location and breakfast, aside from issues above, hotel room was clean",1
"We were in Philly to participate in the recent Philadelphia Marathon and like every other runner in town, decided to have Italian for dinner ( carb-loading) . The management at Barra certainly did not know about the marathon and were not prepared for every seat in the house to be filled from 7-9pm. Originally reserved as a party of 4, we arrived 15 min early and requested to add 1 more seat for dinner and were told by the manager to sit at the bar and he ,""hoped a table would open up for us"". My friends and I thought this was strange, as we knew they would just add one more seat to our original table ( which they did). Why make a big deal, Barra? Seating was an issue-note to anyone planning to eat here-the seating along the wall (leather lounge bench) has much less cushioning that expected..you drop down a few inches and it makes uncomfortable seating for dinner. You will need to sit at the very edge of the bench(wooden area) to be at the same level as those seated in chairs and to eat your meal. Our appetizer,Margherita Pizza,arrived in 20 min (a bit of a wait, but we understood they were busy) and was delicious. Our dinners arrived 30 min after we finished the pizza (obviously some grumbles here, hungry runners are not happy people) Dinner -Penne and Meatballs for me, Lasagna, Chicken Parm for others was underwhelming. MIne arrived cold and the meatballs were dry and tasteless. I hope next year Barra will be prepared for the arrival of carb-loading runners who love Italian cuisine pre-marathon, but we will be dining elsewhere.",-1
"Perfect as usual! Exactly what I needed after I was disappointed at a different fast food restaurant. The great customer service from our server Izzy was appreciated, and the manager even stopped by to check on us. Our drinks were refilled before they were even empty and the food was awesome! Keep it up!",1
"So, I had a craving for a slinger and used Yelp to help find a local place to get one, leading me to George Rivolo's Diner. I walked in and was amazed at how small the place was. I counted around 15 seats total. The seats were a bit worn down and could have definitely used some cushions (I actually did hurt my butt sitting down on those things). I browsed through the menu, found my singer (and was disappointed at the up charge to have meat in it). So I watched as the lady behind the counter made my food.

While waiting I have to point out how immaculately clean the kitchen was. Having worked in several restaurants I know how much work it takes to keep a kitchen as spotless as this place was and I have to say that alone impressed me and told me that the people who own this place care. 

Once I got my food I figured, ""yep... that's a slinger"". I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more chili on it, and I felt that the chili and burger meat could have done with some seasoning. However that being said, it was okay for diner food. Not something I'd go out of my way for, but not something I'd avoid either. If the owner took the time to add a bit more flavor to the food this would be a place worth visiting regularly for me. As it stands though, i can't really give high recommendation for this place unless you are already in the neighborhood and craving some diner food.",1
"Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!  I have a new favorite restaurant in town and Home Wine Kitchen is IT.  The schiznIT, in fact.

We celebrated my birthday at HWK last night.  Originally, we tried to get into Farmhaus (my other fave resto in STL) totally last minute and were told we could either dine outside (in 102 degree weather?  Huh-uh.) or come in at 8:30, which didn't jive with our babysitting situation.  So I called HWK, which I've been dying to try since I drove by and spied their sweet space on Manchester.  You people in Maplewood are incredibly lucky to have this restaurant in your midst.  Bow low.

We were warmly greeted by one of the owners, Josh, and heard about a few revisions to the ever-changing menu.  I like a place that refuses to serve a dish due to sub-par ingredients and yesterday the sardines didn't pass the perfection inspection, so they were nixed from the appetizer menu.  No problem for me as I had my eye on the potted pork appetizer, which was outstanding.  The well-seasoned, unctuous spread contrasted nicely with the crisp grilled bread and paired well with pickled radishes, coarse mustard and red onions.  I had a tiny scoop left when the bread ran out and I had it boxed up so none would go to waste.  No potted pork left behind!

Since it's the perfect time of year for stellar tomatoes and glorious, sugary corn, my husband and I were torn between the sides of creamed corn and heirloom tomatoes.  We asked our server if he thought we might be overdoing it if we ordered both sides in addition to our entrees (since we weren't familiar with HWK's portion sizes) and he suggested we'd do fine with just one side... Buuuuuuut, I said it was BIRTHDAY DINNER and how could we pass up two dishes made up of ingredients so absolutely at their prime?  We couldn't.  We ordered the tomatoes and the corn and the chicken and the wild boar.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness, not because the portions were tiny (in fact, I'd say they were fairly generous and a really good value), but because the FOOD. WAS. AWESOME.

I couldn't help myself when the little cast iron dish holding the creamed corn made it to the table.  I dove right in to the blessed mix of perfect corn, bacon, green onion and leeks and practically shouted to Justin, ""You have to try this NOW!""  Part of me wishes I hadn't been so exuberant about it--maybe I wouldn't have had to share so much.  But damn, that was one of the finest side dishes I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Ever.  I almost wept with joy.

The heirloom tomatoes, noted as having thyme, honey and balsamic components on the menu, also arrived in a cast iron dish, which surprised us--I think we were expecting a cold, more salad-like dish.  Don't mistake that for disappointment, though, because these tomatoes were also delicious.  Roasted, sweet and juicy, they tasted like the best fresh, chunky tomato soup you can imagine and the bright yellow, orange and red tomatoes just looked cheery.  Does that sound silly?  Probably.  I'm still giddy from this dinner; indulge me here.

Justin had the wild boar shoulder for dinner, flavored with cumin, orange and currants, slow-cooked in wine and served with fragrant basmati rice.  The boar was topped with orange gremolata, if I'm not mistaken--a mixture of garlic, parsley and orange zest--and Justin was just blown away by the flavor combination.  He said it reminded him of a dinner we shared at Rick Bayless' Topolobampo in Chicago, which, if I had to guess, would probably be rated as his #1 dining experience in his 32 years, so this is really high praise for HWK.  It really was delicious.

I had the chicken entree--a perfectly seasoned, crisp skinned, juicy breast and wing accompanied by arugula, bacon and these surprisingly amazing fingerling potatoes.  I was just shocked by how crisp (not burned; crisp) the outsides were and how creamy delicious the insides were.  The arugula gave them a nice nutty taste and the bacon added a nice saltiness to the dish.  I chose wisely.  And I about licked my plate clean.

I was beyond full at this point in the meal and should've passed on dessert, but I was intrigued by the stone fruit dessert with orange cream.  To be fair, I couldn't eat much more of anything at all, but this was the only item of the night I wasn't head over heels in love with.  The fruit was poached, I believe, with some spices, giving it that Christmas-y, mulled wine sort of taste.  I know lots of people who love that, but it's not my favorite.  Maybe I should've tried the goat cheese tart with honey and pistachios, but I thought its richness might totally put me over the edge... Maybe next time. :)

I enjoyed our server, who was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient, and I loved getting to chat with the owners, Josh and Cassie (who is also the chef).  They've done incredible work on the space and made it a unique, intimate place.  I absolutely cannot wait to head back for more fabulous food and support this new restaurant!",1
Stopped in for a drink. Loud and outgoing environment. The waitress Amanda was attentive and served with a smile. I ordered the Avocado Fritas which were flavorful and fried well.,1
Went back in on a Tues. Bar was busy but cleared out. Single bartender. Four of us ordered some food and drinks. Bartender to worried about chatting with other employees than getting us new drinks. Wasn't very knowledgable on types of alcohol they served. Food was so so at best. Stay away from roast beef sandwich. All of our dirty plates stayed with us till the end. Owner just sat at end of bar oblivious to our situation and other patrons with the same issues. Itll be a loooong time before I eat there again.,-1
"The food was good and the atmosphere was great.  I really wanted to like Sukho Thai, but the service was absolutely horrible.  The woman working there seemed genuinely angry that we would dare eat at her restaurant.  The dessert was good too, but if you order some, prepare for the wrath of the hostess.  It seemed to make her furious that not only did we eat dinner there, but we were also deliberately wasting even more of her time by being so inconsiderate as to order a dessert as well.",1
"I stop here frequently since it is right off the hwy on my way home from work. This is the best of the Schnucks in the city itself, although I have to admit that the bar is pretty low right there. The staff is pleasant compared to the staff at any other city Schnucks, which again is not really that hard to accomplish.

The selection of merchandise could be much better, for instance good luck finding any of the store brand soda in diet, apparently the locals don't care if they are 300+ lbs, as the managers tell me there is no demand for it. The deli is borderline awful and they do a spectacular job of having all of the gristle and fat hidden in the pre-sliced lunchmeat, you figure that out when you get home and you have enough real meat to make a half a sandwich and enough byproduct to feed your cat for several days. Also be sure to check the expiration date on dairy before you buy as I have gotten milk and yogurt home several times to find it days or weeks out of date.

The weirdest part about this place is the cast of derelicts that loiter there daily yet are not escorted off the premises. To the contrary, they seem welcomed, one even wears a Schnucks jacket in the colder months as he panhandles, sifts half smoked cigarette butts out of the butt disposal out front and shuffles about the store looking creepy. Perhaps characters like this are considered quaint by the locals, but they illustrate why I left for south county back in the day.",-1
Somehow 45 minute routine service turned into 2 hours.  I don't think I'll be coming back.,-1
"I work in many areas throughout the Tampabay area!  Today I happened upon this beautiful ""old friend"" and was thrilled to see it still standing and doing business!!!  I was pleasantly surprised as I walked through the main doors and found it to be just as it was but actually even more beautiful!!!  I was in a hurry to meet a client so I decided I was going to place a to go order...:I asked the hostess for a to go order menu and she handed me one and then as I was looking over the menu I expressed my excitement for this place that I once loved so long ago!!!!  She said and I quote ""ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE A TO GO ORDER OR NOT?""  I very nicely handed the menu back to her and turned and left the restaurant!!!!!  Wow!!!!!!!!",1
"When I was reading reviews for this joint it says for ""Just about anything..."" so I thought that they would have some sort of all day menu so they can serve just about anything at anytime of day.  It was our last day in the Clearwater Beach area and my son developed some sort or allergy from insect bites so we took him to urgent care.  As a result we did not get to Kelly's until 3:00 PM.  When they handed us this one page menu I was so surprised to see that there was not much to choose from.  I had my heart set on getting a late breakfast.  My son wanted to eat fish and they only had one fish dish on the menu :-(. I was ready to get up and leave but my husband felt bad because the server was already getting our waters.  We ordered buffalo wings, grouper sandwich, and grilled cheese.  The buffalo wings was good, the grouper sandwich was just ok, the grilled cheese was good too.  The server was really nice and gave me the option of getting both the bbq sauce and ranch dressing for the wings. We ordered a key lime pie, we did not want to leave Florida without having one, it was beautifully presented and tasted good.   If I ever come back I would make sure I go during breakfast",1
I heard great things about this restaurant so we put our name down for a party of 4 on a friday night and the hostess told us it would be 30 min - 1 hour wait and to go grab a drink down the street somewhere since their bar was crowded. We went down the street to Boogaloo and a friend decided to join us so we called the hostess and asked to add our reservation to 5. After waiting for one hour we received a call from the hostess and she told us they would not be able to fit us in that evening. It was now 9:00 and we had already waited an hour...had we know they wouldn't seat us we would not have waited an hour to eat. We walked down the street to speak to the manager and he did not have a solution nor was he willing to squeeze us in. I was not impressed by this service. I wouldn't recommend this place. We ended up eating at Acero and it was excellent and they were welcoming and had great service.,-1
"I waited to go a second time before writing a review.  One positive: a variety of healthy smoothie options with fresh ingredients. I really appreciate the lack of added sugars or overuse of ice. However, my first experience far exceeded my most recent visit. The inconsistency in the smoothies makes me hesitant to return. I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn't know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.  Considering South Tampa's dedication to Xtreme Juice, I  doubt this place will last long given the inconsistency in the smoothies and lack of a BOGO option on Sundays.",-1
"Just went during lunch on a Friday. Not very busy and service was slow. The gal who waited on me was not friendly at all. However, the food was good. The omelet was very bland, but the greens, sweet potato wedges, and cookie had a lot of flavor. The atmosphere was swanky and cool, minus the old school ceiling. That aside, I will be back to try something else on the menu and hope for friendlier service!",1
"Every time we go to this place, we go because of the enticing beer selections, but time after time we leave disappointed by a complacent bar staff that makes you feel like an inconvenience. It's such a shame. The beer selection is second to none, but this time we had one drink and decided to spend our money elsewhere for dinner. This place has been consistent for sure, every time we go, we get a miserable bartender who seems like they'd rather be working on a slow night when they don't have to talk to people. All of the enticing beer in the world won't bring us back. 

The owners brother has a great place a few miles away, Brickside Grill, we went there instead...good beer, excellent food and the staff is consistently friendly and engaging!",1
"If I based my review only on my meal, I'd have to give it one star.  But everyone else in my party of 10 enjoyed their meal, and we had a great time.  I ordered the vegetarian meal, and it was the WORST veggie meal I've ever had :(  My meal came with soup and rice, just like everyone else, but when the others got their choice of meat I got a plateful of sliced red peppers.  That's all.  Sliced red peppers.  Uh,   how about some mushrooms or zuchini or squash or about a million other veggie options.  Fortunately, I'd had enough sake bombs not to get too upset about it!",-1
"A quasi political rant and a store review all wrapped in one, so enjoy. 

Ever since Target hit the scene I really have to ask, ""Who even goes to Kmart anymore?"" I asked this to myself out loud the other day as I had to get my meds filled due to a sinus infection. No one looked at me odd, as there seemed to be several people talking to themselves. I now go here because of the stolid contractual war between Express Scripts and Walgreens. Thanks you two....idiots.....qausi-political rant over.

This store is harshly bright, rather dingy, and the selections, especially in the electronic section, are on the cheaper end.  On top of that, I've found the mainstream DVD and Blu-Ray movies are overpriced.  I laughed at the men's area, especially the young man's department, as they had a tv with music videos playing. I laughed because it just seemed a lame attempt to be cool and creating a shopping experience that you will find at a department store like Macy's or Dillard's. This is hard to create when everything is whitewashed. You will feel like you are in that August Burns Red's ""Whitewashed.""  The best WTF moment is discovering the opportunity to purchase Joe Boxer male thongs. Who knew that Kmart cared about male panty line?

One great tip is you can find patio furniture cheap during the off season and clearance days. I bought a great patio table for under $50. So, keep that in mind.

The extra star is for the pharmacy, as they filled my prescription out efficiently and with the greatest of ease. The hours are little later than Target.  No problems there and credit when credit is due!

The later 80s quote, ""K-Mart sucks"", remains as true as ever and who knows, you may even bump into someone who still dresses from that Tom Cruise era who cares about male panty line. One never knows?",1
Ok pizza-Margarita pie was burnt! I mean charred. They brought a new one a bit late . Never got bread. Not sure I'll go back...,-1
"A lil cozy bar/restaurant on Frenchman Street.  Small plates, good music and service.",1
"Still without a sign, this Han location might be a bit difficult to find.  We managed to spot it and doubled back.  Unfortunately, the kitchen had just closed.  Luckily, they were willing to prepare us something to go.  We kept it simple on them and ordered the dan dan noodles.  

Don't take the 3-star review the wrong way, the food was great.  However, it seemed no where near as good as the Manayunk location, which I also tried shortly after it first opened.  Considering it was to-go and knowing Han doesn't put out 3-star food, I'll be back (when the kitchen is open) to give them another shot at boosting the score.",1
"The  husband and I went to Cappy's on a whim..  Every other time we have wanted to go there they have been closed.  I do admit the hours they are open are few, but it was worth it.
We had the Italian Style Pepperoni Pizza, which is basically NY style. So so good!!!
There is so much cool stuff there!  You won't know where to look first!!!   This is such a cool place!   The patio section is so pretty and serene. 
Cappy's got a 4 rating from me only because when we were there they had an extremely loud group sitting in the middle.  They were awful!

Aside from that is our new fav!  You must go!!!!  Be careful, you could spend a good hour just looking around at all the cool things they have there!",1
I got the chicken waffles it was very delious and flavorful. They should expand their breakfast menu because some items you had to get separately causing the price to increase a lot.,1
"I typically only write reviews for excellent service and like to say I try to see the best in people. However our experience at shelter compelled me to share my experience.

We reserved an hour for bowling to celebrate a birthday.  By the time the hour was up, we had 4 people yet to finish their 10th frame.  This was perfectly fine. I walked over and asked for a 5 minute extension even offering more money for the courteous extension to finish our round.  I was then directed to the bartender who said he would do this, great!  While we waited for our match to come back online, someone came over and told my me and my fiancee to get off our seats because another group was coming. Of course we don't mind moving and sharing space once the other group gets there but there was aggression in his tone.  I assumed this man was just a sour person from the next group, but I later discovered he was actually the owner rudely telling us to move our rear ends.

After several minutes our scores disappeared, and I went to check in on the extra time still thinking this should be a simple fix and in good spirits.  I was told by the person I originally asked that he was too busy and that I should have talked to him when it first happened (this is the same person I initially talked to who redirected me to the bartended) because our scores are gone. He then redirected me to the owner who irritably said you're scores are gone, you can buy another hour if you want.  After I began to become upset, he backtracked and then offered 5 minutes but our scores  were still gone and his tone was still ""get out of my face, I don't care""

I understand mistakes happen and that's not the reason for my negative review.  Customer service was non existent. My entire party felt like a nuisance and not a customer.  The owner should be the pinnacle for customer service, but I have little doubt he is a reason that shelter has a limited lifespan.  It's a shame because it is a beautiful bar.",-1
"OK, so... the person who loooooves the aforementioned eclairs must not get out much, because I finally tried one, and it was the texture of sun-dried cardboard.",1
"Nothing too special about this bar that makes it different from any other bar, but they do serve Hand Grenades and those are really good (frozen or on the rocks).",1
"I went here for a company holiday party and was unable to order any alcoholic beverages because I didn't have my ID. I understand that it is mandatory for bartenders to ID and it was a misunderstanding on my part as well, but I had already been served one drink already before they even decided to ask for my ID. On top of that they never asked anyone else who appeared under 27 for their ID. I felt singled out and they continued to serve drinks to others without ever asking for ID. They even hassled my date and other people sitting at our table just because I didn't have my ID. On top of that their bouncers did a sub par job keeping uninvited guests out of the area and it was up to other guests to facilitate and ask the people to leave. On the bright side the food was great. The one drink I was served was good as well. Overall unknowledgeable staff but good food and atmosphere.",1
"We got here at 6:10p today 3/3/18, and with several open tables we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated, because they were backed up in the kitchen. My guess is there was 1-cook. Our Waitress, Rita who is amazing, had to make our drink order because the 1-Bartender was backed up. Staffing issues are hurting this place! It makes the experience bad for customers. The staff who are here have to work twice as hard, and still not enough to make the experience worth coming back! And at the end of our dinner, we tried to pay using the little computer that sits on every table. This machine would not accept our payment due to technical issues. The waitress even tried, and the people behind us and across from us had the same issue. The waitress went to get the acting Manager (female with dark hair) who upon having to come out to each table to get our credit cards, huffed and puffed, rolled her eyes, and yanked our credit cards from our hands and headed to the back area to run all payments. She came back and set all bills on each table, rather than hand them to all of us, with no apology, turned and walked away. I can honestly say she does not belong in a people business! Wow is all I can say! Will never be back!!!!!",-1
"Ask yourself a question, are you going for food or a blizzard. If it is anything other than a blizzard find a different DQ. Sadly it seems to be ran by young adults not even out of high school so don't expect the beat they have to offer.",-1
"Wicked fast! Pizza from order to eating was seriously 7 minutes! Prices aren't bad either. About $8 for a do it yourself, unlimited toppings. The pizza is decent, customizable so you can make it to your taste. The crust is plain, no seasonings. But it's nice and light. Sauce is very mild. They go very, very! light on the toppings so I found I had to request extra of nearly everything. Over all I think it's a great quick bit, works well for travel with a small person who eats only when he wants, what he wants. I'd go back!",1
"Had my phone inside a LIFEPROOF case and less than a week later, accidentally dropped it on a CARPETED floor and the screen shattered. Not so impressed anymore.

Oh, and it took a day or so to really notice, but their reinstallation include a slanted home button. (Is this related to the enormous shatter across the new screen, Apple people?)",-1
"I had no idea pudding could be this good! I went here late in the day hoping to score a cupcake (or two), but they were all out. Which turned out to be a boon because I probably would have overlooked the pudding otherwise. We were offered samples of banana pudding, peanut butter pudding, and strawberry banana pudding, each as delicious as the last. This stuff is like the Häagen-Dazs of pudding: rich, creamy, and indulgent. In fact, it's closer to eating custard-y ice cream than any pudding you've ever had. We'll definitely be back for more since the two containers we took home with us are sadly already gone.",1
Customer service here is lacking. We stood there watching an employee restock the ice cream bins for a good while until he decided/realized that we wanted some. Customers should be a priority in my opinion.,-1
"I eat lunch here 1 to 2 times a week and have very good consistency in the quality of the food and service. They really do offer fresh food items and breads, oh your sweet tooth can also be satisfied with their pastries! I only do the pastries on the weekends as one of my coworkers has told me that calories don't count on the weekends!",1
"Decent food, decent amounts. Just order a few different plates and share with the others at the table.",1
Last time I ate at La Casona (and it's been about 2 years now) I ordered the Pollo relleno a la casona and it made me incredibly sick. I had ordered mofongo in previous ocassions and it was good. Service was very slow too and it seems it hasn't change based on recent reviews I have read on Yelp.,-1
"Great place to eat, even with a horrible waitress the manager was there to compensate. Taking off incorrect meals off the bill as well as providing half off our future meals. Great customer service even with a shit waitress and good food a majority of the time.",1
"Better than Hooters for both food and scenery.  The servers here are certainly friendlier.

The food is okay, basically pub food.  The menu is small, but who comes to a restaurant like this looking for an expansive menu?

We've been in a couple of times for lunch.  They usually are seating immediately.

The biggest downside is the parking lot.  Some of those potholes could swallow a car.",1
"First time at Wolfgang. Crowded, dirty floors, poor service, it has it all. Only redeeming factor was the excellent crisp Chardonnay.",-1
"Dean's Service was not professional or reliable at all.  I called to get a diagnosis and they got to my rental property and gave me misinformation.  I left messages for Jenny to call me back to get an estimate and a good time to complete the repair and I am still waiting for her to call me back.
I had to call another company to do what Dean's Service was unable to do.  I will never call them back again nor would I refer them to anyone.",-1
"This is an outstanding Italian market
Friendly staff 
Takes me back to childhood days and all the Italian markets I shopped at with my grandparents 
Very old world 
Lots of goodies to find 
many rooms filled with Italian culture 
They offer 1 gluten free pastry at the bakery counter it's a chocolate moose cake out standing 
No gluten free pizza which is sad and I hope they change soon !!
There were prepackaged cookies and gluten free Italian items to be found 
It was my first visit, I am planning a second very soon",1
"Just had a ""ramen"" delivered... All I'm going to say is, you're better off eating the instant ramen soup! First time I tried this place and I'm sure it will be the last.",-1
Don't like the decoration. It looks like a fast food place instead of a sit down restaurant. I ordered lamb curry and it was tasty.,1
"Sierra and her sidekick, India, took impeccable care of my family last weekend during a family reunion.  We came to Santa Barbara from all over the world, and Sierra not only took care of purchasing everything we needed ahead of time, but she also thought of things we didn't think of, and went out multiple times to replenish drinks and food we went through.  They were flexible, fun, thorough and all-around fabulous.  I hope I have another event in Santa Barbara in the future, just so I can use JOTSB!",1
Went for lunch and tried the duck mac n cheese n the duck fries along w a salad. Everything was awesome!  Fries are addicting ..ive bn craving them ever since!  One point  it was 340 pm and we asked our server if they had desserts. she replied yes but not until 4pm.  Never turn down a customer because of 20minutes..they lost out on at least another 10$ on bill.  Besides that one quirk I would say if your not there right now eating you should be!,-1
"Chicken was great.. Mashed potatoes were bland and a little on the runny side. Portions were really small for the price. Two pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and an average tasting biscuit for $11.00. Could have gotten more food from Lees.. Granted the chicken wouldn't have been as good but for $11.00 I would have had leftovers.",-1
"This is one of the best experiences I have had in an Extended Stay America motel. The manager comped my room for a minor mishap and I stayed another night. There was a broken drawer in the nightstand and the shower curtain was hung too high, like a LOT of hotels I have been in, and that sent water all over the floor but the staff made up for all of that. I would recommend this motel again.",1
"This is some good motherfuckin ice cream.

Positive:
+Tell me you're serving bananas foster today!
+Freshly made waffle cones
+Establishment doesn't look like a fucking kindergarden.  I can eat ice cream and still feel like an adult
+Owner is a Harvard grad, but isn't a stuck up asshole.  Actually seems pretty down to earth and can hold a conversation with the layman.

Negative:
-I'm reaching, but I kinda wish this place was located by the movie theater.  Would be nice to park once and make this part of an evening out.  The only time I really think about this place is after rolling out of Publix and by then I've already got bags of frozen food thawing out and dont have time for ice cream.  Not even some bad ass ice cream.

Hey... even 5 star joints could use some constructive criticism",1
"We walked through the whole space without a single ""can I help you"", the products are most certainly not ""more-than-old"", this is a glorified gift shop. Goodwill finds at vintage store prices, but I suppose what else can be expected nearby some of the most expensive vintage shops in Philadelphia. The curation in this one is lacking.",1
"This place has grown on me, 6 months ago it would have been a 3, now I know what I like on the menu Ive moved it to a 4. The lady at the counter speaks little English so that's an issue with phone orders but they use fresh veggies and everything is made to order. 5.75, for 2 items with chow mein is hard to beat.",1
"Picked-up my rug bedizened with dog vomit. 
Brought my rug back a week later looking like new.",1
"I have used ""vrbo"" and home away websites for a longtime. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a site. My friends and I were trying to book a place for the Essence Festival in July. We knew how the housing would be an issue so we started looking for a place to stay at the end of Feb. We saw the French Quarter Suites offered Town homes, they looked nice, so we began to inquire. The process is usually pretty easy but working with Ms. Leslie was not. When asking questions about a 5br town home she would often skirt the questions and not give direct answers. She raised the prices on our stay, without our knowledge and refused to breakdown the price of our payment.  The pay for parking was never mentioned, and the we had to inquire why the invoice stated the town home was a one room annex NOT a 5 bedroom town house. The Frech Quarter Suites Hotel website and business are misleading and dishonest.",-1
"Sides seem to be their forte. They are good. Sadly, Ribs are fatty and tough-do not fall off bone. So only 2 stars",-1
Very nice hotel & Resturant!  But really? Slowest service in the history of serving! Over an hour to get food for breakfast and not busy at all!  What's the dealeo?,-1
"Stayed here for a conference at the hotel so that was convenient. Location isn't near any of the action per se, but everything Is Within a mile or less so not that big of a deal unless it is torrential rain, which of course it was! My two biggest complaints are the beds are so uncomfortable. Like, crazy, how is it even possible for a bed to be made so poorly? If I slept on the ground I might have had a better nights sleep. Pillows need an upgrade too. My second complaint is the noise. You can hear everything, a door closes, a shower starts, people coming in at midnight, 2 am, 3am, 4 am, oh well, wasn't sleeping anyway the beds are so damn hard. The hotel restaurant was pricey, but really decent for a hotel bar. Overall, I wouldn't recommend staying here, there are too many other fabulous locations, but if you had to stay, it's not too bad and the art is cool.",-1
The first my hair was braided and I did not feel pain. I have a big head. My hair was completed in about 4 hours which was great time. Now the downfall is that my braider did not braid my hair pass the length of my natural hair which began to poof out weeks later because I do not have a relaxer. I used human hair because my scalp can no longer tolerate the synthetic hair that is normally used. I was a little upset afterwards because I had to take the braids out in 3 weeks time which was almost like a waste of money.,-1
"Food is average, but the place is too cramped. The owners are also just not friendly. I was made to wait outside in the cold because somebody in my party arrived late despite having a reservation and nobody else in line.",-1
"When a cupcake craving hits (which seems to be happening now, as I write this review ...), I'm most likely to hit up the closest Flying Cupcake location, which is usually this Mass Ave. location. I appreciate that they don't pile on the frosting as much as some other cupcakeries, and they never seem to be lacking in available varieties, from the traditional to the more inventive, regardless of what time I stop in.",1
"My wife & I took 8 kids to the Sanctuary, the kids ages were 5 to 15. We all love it! Mr. Bob gave us a tour of the sanctuary and told us about all the different types of parrots. He is very passionate about the birds and it shows. He taught the kids things about parrots and at dinner time that night the kids were excited to answer questions I asked about parrots. Me. Bob made sure each kid got a feather from a bird too. It was a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours in the morning and well worth the 1.5 hour drive (1 way) to get there. We are planning another trip next spring to visit again. When your there, make sure you pet Jack the dog too.",1
"While there are many Bath & Body Works that are larger in size than this one, this B&B offers everything one needs and wants from the chain. For those of you that have never tried their products before, you must! The products here are fantastic. My cousin has eczema and this is the only place she can buy hand soap.",1
"Had high expectations since it's always tough to snag a table. Unfortunately today's brunch was nothing spectacular...my chicken and waffles were terrible. My husband ordered the burger which was good, but outside of that, nothing blew us away. The seating is also really cramped...and the loud couple nearby watching videos on their phone was annoying to say the least.",-1
"All my St. Louis reviews are coming after the fact, I was there last summer.

Here is what I recall about Rue 13.  Tuesday, It was the first bar that I set foot in about an hour after landing.  I met a friend that lives in the Lou and a bunch of his friends.  The place was cool quiet and the crowd was friendly.

Fast forward to Thursday, 80's night decent crowd.  I've been a DJ for a decade so I have heard and seen a lot, but his DJ was the possibly the worst DJ I have ever heard.  

I'm not just talking from a technical standpoint (that was awful too) but his selections were so played out and tired.  I realize that it's hard not to be played out when you are doing an 80's  night but playing Micheal Jackson four times ?  C'mon buddy.

Over all I'd say the bar is alright but I prefered the slower night.",1
"Not sure what happened to this place. A few years back I really loved it, but every time I've gone in the food has been increasingly bland. Their pad ke mao is really mediocre. It has very little flavor and is made with regular egg noodles like you'd find in tuna casserole. I keep hoping I go on an off night but it's clear that their standards have slipped. There are many more Thai options in town.",-1
"Not bad. The proximity to the beach and other businesses on the main strip is nice, but I would put it in the category of average thai food. Not bad, but nothing that makes me do jumping jacks.",1
"There are some days when you are so desperate for a cup of coffee that you will pay a fortune. So imagine my surprise on one of these days when the total for a cup of large coffee landed me less than three bucks in, of all places, Clayton. I had heard some mixed reviews about this small chain and I decided to give it a go since I was in the area. I honestly have tasted better, and the buzz I got didn't last very long for a large. And on top of that, I didn't get the best service during the 2 or 3 minutes I was in the shop. Hmm...",-1
"Stayed in the Hilton St Charles. As the mardi gras parades had the streets blocked, we opted not to venture out and ordered to go here. Food was good, service at the bar was fine. The staff was friendly.  The restaurant was fairly busy (Saturday night), but not too loud. The guy next to me had mussels that looked awesome.  Maybe next time.",1
"First visit.  Food was generally good.  One of the few places where I can get Eggs Benedict,but the Hollandaise was a little vinegary.  The soup special tasted like Chef Boy-ar-dee mini ravioli watered down with tomato  juice.  Other food served to our party was generally good and enjoyable.

The service was acceptable, but much less than awesome.  Waitress refused to even check on the possibility of upcharging for a BOWL of soup rather than a cup with the 1/2 sandwich, and instead just claimed ""we can't do that"".  She also claimed she ""didn't know"" about some of the ingredients in one of the dishes, and made no effort to check with the kitchen to find out.

It's a 'pay as you leave"" place, and the cash register is right next to the main entrance.  Things could get a little tight during a rush, and we had some problem checking out when a family with small, somewhat unruly children arrived at the same time.  Maybe they should insist that the waitress take the check?

Overall: 8 out of 10

"I am sad to see the ingredient changes of the Make It Grain salad and the Walnut Noodle Salad. I wonder why? Usually eat here 2-3 times a week, as my office is down the street. Used the app all of the time and my order was always ready. Thought they made a mistake putting broccoli in my Walnut Noodle Salad instead of cauliflower, but when it happened again, I googled it. Sure enough, they swapped out key ingredients. Same for Make It Grain. Why, HoneyGrow??",-1
"I wish I could rate this place higher as it's the only place in the city with my all time favourite beer on tap, however the three stars is fair. 

Even when you sit at the wood here the service is normally a bit slow and standoffish which is odd.  

The room itself isn't exactly inviting and the setup just seems off.  I can't pinpoint what it is but it doesn't feel comfortable really at all.  

Good specials and they had decent food which is nice that's in their favor.  

Keep the Rogue Nut Brown on tap and I'll still be coming back.",1
"Never have I had such over cooked seafood, one of the worst temperature cooked scallops and octopus I've ever had. The romesco from the scallops was delicious, but ruined by the fact they were completely over cooked. Don't even get me started on the octopus, chewed like beef jerky. Kitchens gone down, wait staff was kind if there but never when needed",-1
"We came for a Sunday brunch, and the place is amazing. We wanted to get a tour of the distillery, usually if the Brewster is there, they would totally do it, but because it was his day off, and the restaurant was busy, we didn't get a chance to do the tour. However, the manager was extremely kind, he offered to tour us when rush hour is over, we just couldn't really wait around. You can peak at the distiller through the bar though!

Really like their drinkware!

I had the bone marrow plate, and it was very good. Came with crispy toast. Other snack that looked interesting including the duck plate.

The brunch menu wasn't too interesting, but overall the food quality is good.

Nice beer and cocktail menu!",1
"Let me start by saying I have been eating at BKs for as long as I can remember, when they were just a cart on the Southside. 

I prefer this location because of the atmosphere and the micheladas. The food is always great but the last few times I've been there it has been a bad experience. After this last time I will not ever be returning. 

We took some friends there on a Sunday at around 4:30pm. It was busy but no wait. We sat outside where at the time there was only one other couple sitting there. Placed our orders fairly quick. Server was a bit distracted but no biggie. After almost 2 hours and being told a few times our food was on its way we asked what was going on. Our server stated the manager was on her way to explain. A young female brought us a free appetizer and stated it was for the long wait. We kept waiting for the manager and nothing. Once we saw the server again about 30min later she informed us the manager was the one who brought the appetizer. What!? She never said anything so we asked to speak to her. She returned with attitude said the steaks were frozen and they were on their way. She pretty much played the victim and was blaming us for ordering steak at a Carne asada restaurant,  lol. 

She did give us a discount at the end but I really didn't care about that part she should have explained what was going on about 2 hours earlier.  Horrible manager and reason why I will not go back.",-1
"I am an amateur athlete. I first met Dr. Ferrel when I was playing softball. He was watching my game when I was severely injured.  He treated me on the field by relocating my ankle and then told me to come to his office for treatment. I told him I could not afford that as a single mom on a teacher's salary. Instead, I saw a physician. He said it would be months before I would play again. Depressed and without much hope, I reached out to Dr. Ferrel again. He did treat me as he promised. Not only did he treat me, he healed me within weeks instead of months. Over the years Dr. Ferrel has worked on me with amazing results each time. He will always be my hero...",1
"Update after initial review:  ordered again last night using the yelp eat24 app. Food was ready within 10 minutes of placing the order. I opted for pickup since I was on my way home. The app did not give them my correct phone # and speaking to the great staff at the reception desk they told me sometimes yelp gets the addresses wrong for delivery so my advice is to type your phone # and address (if using delivery) into the comments box just so you get your food as fast as they intend to get it to you. 

This is the best place for sushi in the area. We have frequented other sushi places and this one by far stands above the rest. Was happy to see Saturday night was very busy for them, and my takeout was still ready in under 10 minutes!!",1
"The food is over rated, it's good, but not as to die for as everyone has told me. This Italian market / deli combo is jam packed with stuff everywhere, making it nearly impossible to wait in line to order on an average day without touching anyone around you or anyone trying to press through to the patio. I am very uncomfortable with strangers pushing me around while I try to figure out what food should be ordered at which counter, struggling to glimpse the options behind the glass, and understand what the ordering process is and which convoluted line is the one I need to be in. The people taking the orders are not helpful in making the process clear, assuming everyone has been here before and knows the deal. They don't say, ""for here or to go"" so they can heat up the food for you, they don't have a clear spot at any of the counters for customers to go up to without having to push their way through a series of people who might have already ordered, could be waiting to order, or are trying to figure out what to order, there's no way to tell one crowd from the other. When you eventually figure it out the first time around and get your food, you might have ordered multiple items, but there's no trays to make sure you can carry all of the food out to the pay station and then to the patio, or bags for to go orders(I'm pretty sure if you asked for one they could get one, but I should not have to ask, especially with my hand in a cast) so you guard yourself against bumps as best you can to hope the food you waited so uncomfortably for doesn't get knocked out of your hands, forget trying to make a single trip for food and drinks, you won't make it. Speaking of their ""coffee bar"" they're always super busy, scrambling around, and I got skipped over while waiting to order my drinks, then it proceeded to take about 8-10 minutes to get my drinks and pay for them, all whilst growing ever more hungry with each passing minute. The pizza looked really good, especially the ""chicken and vodka"" pizza, but it wasn't very flavorful and it's all extremely messy to eat. The patio space is very limited, so you might have to wait to get a seat, or have a seat taken while you go inside for the necessary second trip. The mist fans are a good concept, but it does nothing but agitate me further as I try to keep napkins on the table, the parchment paper from under certain foods,such as pizza and pastries, from flying away or up in the way as we ate, and keeping my hair out of my face and food as the water droplets blow directly on everything. Being in a group with a friend in a wheelchair was difficult, we had to somehow clear a space through the mass of indifferent people packed into the store from the front door to the back, with too few handicap spaces having to park in the rear of the parking lot. As a disabled veteran myself, the overwhelming environment made me uneasy, and the invasion of my personal space made me anxious and extremely uncomfortable. Add this to the inaccessibility of the entrance and exit due to the sheer volume of people going in and out of the limited doors and the maze of a parking lot through which my handicapped friend had to go through as cars pulled in and out without regard for their surroundings, and it is a logistical nightmare. I will not be returning despite my group's general enjoyment of the food and their continuing patronage. The systems in place to get the food they enjoy(mostly the pastries) are frustrating to them but they can overlook it. I cannot.",-1
"I went here with my aunt last Tuesday for all you can eat crab legs. What an experience!!?! The service was wonderful and the crab legs were the best I've ever eaten! Our server was a young girl and I believe she was training someone so we got extra special attention, which was nice! The salad was fresh and served on frozen plates along with their fresh garlic bread. The crab legs came out fresh and hot and were served with mashed potatoes and an ear of corn. My only complaint is that after the initial order, they only bring out one crab claw at a time when you order more. This was a little disappointing since we were ordering all you can eat and definitely came to eat more than one at a time. The server was accommodating though and let us know that she would put in a new order each time she delivered our new plate so we never had to wait, which was nice. You can tell they don't mass cook the crab legs because they come out hot and steaming each time. The manager came over to check on us twice and ask how our experience was. Overall we had an enjoyable evening and will definitely return!",1

"Wallet was stolen today at this starbucks.  The workers there were not helpful at all.  They wanted me to ""file a report"" to corporate and would call if it showed up.  Meanwhile someone was having fun with my credit card in cherry hill, new jersey.  And they made it seem like it was my fault that it was stolen, but it was stolen when i was sitting with my items. Not helpful or sympathetic.",-1
"I went to the buffet for a basic breakfast because it was close to the cafes price.  I thought the buffet had good choices (although I didn't try everything and I realize that everyone's favorites might not be there).  I just had bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns and a cinnamon roll.  Everything was at least satisfactory except the cinnamon roll, which was excellent.  It was the only roll I've found that is comparable to Cinnabon's.  Maybe the roll was a little soft, but that was more than made up for by the flavor.  I knew it would be bad, but I had to go back for seconds.  It took a lot of willpower not to just stay and eat roll after roll, especially since by that point they were effectively free.  I don't know how lunch and supper buffets are, which is why this os only four stars, but the cinnamon rolls are five stars in my book.  And the service was also very good.",1
Loved the abvionce.. got pampered and relaxed. It was hard to get a drink order place. Was the only reason I did not give them a 5. Had to ask 4 people before I was told to go call roommservice on the white phone.,1
"All I wanted was some dessert. That's it. I mean, you try resisting the words ""cheesecake scoops"" paired with the beautiful dessert display here. Especially when you're waiting for several hours for your flight!

It unfortunately took me a looooooong time to get that cup of sugary goodness. Despite the name, Copeland's Cheesecake Scoops doesn't just offer dessert - and there were some serious problems in their kitchen when I stopped by. I distinctly heard the staffers complaining that someone had just walked off before I arrived. Whether they walked off for a break or left for good, I don't know. I just know that the people left working were left at a loss and the line of customers came to a standstill.

EVENTUALLY (I think it was at least 10 minutes later) the line got moving again and we all managed to get our food. And hey, the bowl of fruity-and-cakey goodness I got was certainly lovely (hence my giving this place two stars instead of one). 

But if I were traveling through this airport again, I doubt I'd give this particular business another chance. The staffers were clearly not communicating amongst themselves, let alone with the guests; and no effort was made to keep us posted on what was happening, or how long it would be before food came out of their kitchen. 

Hopefully, for my fellow travelers' sakes, they can find a better balance between good food and good customer service in the future!",-1
"This is a cool set-up and has some good looking menu items. Their milk tea was pretty good and their menu seems to have a pretty wide selection to spice up your drink. I would give this three stars because their menu does not make much sense and is just a busy looking mess of words. If they separate and streamline the menu, it will make their menu better. Also mentioning that their fruit teas are blended would be helpful because when it says fruit tea, that's not what is expected. The drinks that were ordered came out quick and were pretty good which gives this review 4 stars out of 5. Hopefully this place will do well as it seems to have opened recently and are figuring everything out!",1

"If you are looking for a small quaint place to have a good plate of Pho as you come in from the cold in Avon then this is the place!! I was introduced to Pho 36 by my co-workers after I first arrived to the area and have got to say that I will be coming back.

The portions are generous for the cost, and the service was excellent.  The waitress was friendly and was very quick to ask if we wanted anything else.  She would continually come back and check in on us.

I got their Chicken Pho and it was really good.  Everyone in our party was very satisfied with their choices and we did not leave hungry.  I can't wait to come back and bring my family.",1
"Four of us had dinner at the Sockeye Grill this weekend.  Service was terrible.  Super slow.  Salads were warm and tasteless.  Dressing was watered down. 

Salmon was excellent.  Nachos were okay. Finger steaks were mushy and drab. 

Waitress  knew her beer. The dark lager was excellent.  The lighter beers we had were too warm. 

Looks like this restaurant need some fine tuning.  The atmosphere was like a warehouse, more like being in a barn than a restaurant. 

Tvs everywhere but the news was on. Huh? How depressing is that? 

We won't be back.",-1
I was surprised on my last trip to Philly that they have these shops now to make pretzel buying easier.  Pretzels were a great price and tasted just like I am used to.  They have several dipping options and they even sell sandwhiches and other items besides just the pretzels.,1
"I ordered chicken tikka masala and fish curry for dinner. They didn't taste as fresh and good as I have expected. However, the owner of restaurant called back right away and apologized. I was impressed by the restaurant's candor and diligence in customer satisfaction. Thus, I think I am going to go back and try it again in a few weeks to see whether there is any improvement in the quality of food.",1
"The tram tour up and down the canyon is strictly for the walker and stroller crowd. If you hope to see something interesting, be prepared to be disappointed. Use it as a ""bus"" to get to some of the more interesting places.

Based on some of the reviews I read, I have to say that my expectations were set a little too high and the reality did not live up to the enthusiastic gushing. The only ""wildlife"" I saw was of the whiney, two-legged variety.",-1
"I went here again last week and it does not disappoint. Please try the shrimp and grits if you go,  I promise you won't be disappointed!",1
"Nope nope and nope again
Rude hostess 
Always some nonesense with seating and sushi is mediocre at best... 
yes it's dirt cheap but it's also dirt food & dirt service 
Oh the kicker - ginger smells like amonia
Gave this place a couple tries 
Never again",-1
"Folks may disagree with me, but I have to be the first to not give this restaurant the five stars that it is used to getting. I will first state the positives. The flavors of the curries and other stews are simply delicious; they are doing everything right with what seemed like very authentic tastes and aromas. Now here is my particular issue: this restaurant chooses to curry salmon. It is my fault, really, as I should have asked what fish was to be used in the curry fish dish. Had I known it was salmon I would have passed. Salmon is not a fish for curry, in my opinion. With that said, please note that this is a rather personal opinion and is based completely on the one issue. The restaurant is clean and the service provided is that from good people, no qualms on those points.",1
"4 weeks ago I answered an add looking for women to enter into a 6 week challenge. I saw it as an opportunity to get back on track and maybe spend some time on myself. I really am absolutely impressed with Becky and her Fox Fitness workouts. Although she makes you work, the workouts (interval &  buddy) are fun and over before you notice it. I look forward to going each week, am getting ME back and am noticing changes already. Her help with nutrition is a bonus! I encourage anyone of any level who is looking for something new, meet new people, improve your strength and improve your nutrition to come check out Fox Fitness!",1
"I normally LOVE Bailey's Range, but tonight was extremely disappointing. Our server seemed really nice at first to our table of four, but as the night went on, we saw her paying more attention to the table of four behind us. She was attentive to them, and checking in on them regularly. At one point we were out of water. Someone else had stopped to bring us more water. We had to flag down our server to get another drink for my friend, but she left so quickly after that, that we were not able to order for the rest of the table. While we waited, we noticed the table on the other side of us got all of their food...they were seated about 20 minutes after us. Our server could not be found for awhile, so my friend got the attention of another worker to see if she could check in on our order...this was over an hour after we were seated. We were seated at 7:33, but did not get our food until 8:45. She did not ask if we needed anything else. Our server never checked in and asked us how our food was. She never apologized that it was busy and that our food took so long. She did ask the four guys behind us many times, and I even heard her say they were getting 16 oz beers for the price of a 9 oz. Wow...how did they get that deal? One of my friends was getting tired, so we decided to ask for the check shortly after we ate our burgers. Our server flew right past our table to the table behind us to ask if they needed anything, then she started to walk away. My friend yelled her name 3 times to get her to come back so we could ask for the check. Still no apologies, no asking how our food or experience was. Personally, I was ready to walk out. But my friends were kind and still left a tip and did not make a ruckus. I completely understand that you folks were slammed with the Halloween convention in town, but it's no excuse for poor customer service, especially to those that live downtown and frequent your restaurant and recommend it to others. It's going to take me a long time to go back, if I ever do. I certainly will not be recommending it anytime soon. Sad and disappointed on many levels.",-1
"Average food with a really good location. I went for breakfast once and lunch another time. Breakfast was average, same with lunch, which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours. For the lunch visit, we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich. The menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich, but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing. Everything was bland and under seasoned. Wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk, but seemed friendly when they approached our table. Food wasn't 'bad', but the only reason I'd really go back is because of the location and if I was in a hurry, no other reason to really go back, and I live in the immediate area.",1
Ordered the gator bites and creole potatoes. Was told to wait and 15 minutes later I got my plate. The gator was just so tasty and the creole potatoes were awesome too. Have to add that their BBQ Sauce was really delicious. Reading all the bad reviews really makes me wonder if I was at the same place. The service was more than friendly and I left a happy person. 5 stars for some really good food!,1
Came in looking for housewares and furniture.  Didn't find anything worth buying.,-1
"I went there once years ago
I believe I cut my order down when the employee went from picking up trash to picking up my bagels No glove, not even paper.. I don;t recall all the details, but my immediate thought was it's another establishment that has no concept of hygiene and exploits the lack of oversight..To top it off, the bagels were far from fresh
Needless to say, I haven't been back
But I realize many people don't care about cleanliness. If that's you, you'll enjoy this place.",1
"I guess the ingredients weren't as fresh today since my boyfriend threw up twice upon eating chili beef nachos.  We had a to-go order - I got a chicken burrito.  It gave me some stomach cramps and other issues.  Just a heads up.

However, we keep coming back since I love your shredded beef.  I thought I would change it up today.",-1
"Great food, great burgers, great service.... need I say more... just had an Absolutly amazing burger on GF bun best in Tampa

5/18 update.... repeating theme of over cooked burgers, order requests not followed by kitchen and inconsistent food  during different visits.

Was getting used to it but leaving today, another table was talking to waitress that everything was over cooked..an I thought... yep a trend in the wrong direction...

Need to lower my rating and hope management is reading.

Get your kitchen in order... as I heard my self say I will rethink my next visit...",1
"Coming from a family of picky New Yorkers and New Jersey folks, we're spoiled with delicious NY style pizza. This place has been through a few name changes, and the quality of the pizza has declined over the process it seems. 

I went with a friend last week to watch the final butchering of the Colts by Buffalo and eat a pie. We ordered a medium pie, first asking for Capicolla on our pizza, which the guy told us they were out of. We asked for prosciutto - they were out of that too. We opted for salami and Italian sausage. Add a small drink and a bottle of water, it was $21 bucks. 

I expect to pay a good amount for a high quality NYC pizza in Indianapolis, but, we felt like we were scammed when our fresh pizza arrive at the table and we realized that we got less than a few toppings for our money. There were probably two small pieces of salami (which tasted like a slightly glorified pepperoni ala Papa John's) and a few medium-small pieces of Italian sausage on each piece. I should have just ordered a cheese pizza, I would have had an equally as uneventful pizza experience. Even with great NY Style pizza, cheese can be a heavenly experience, but, here, it was boring and uneventful, and the money you pay for the lack of toppings was a joke.

The staff had little to no personality, and they seemed more annoyed that we were there than anything else (we were the only customers, and it was game day and the middle of the afternoon). 

I'm disappointed by the quality  and I have no intention on heading back to Bella's, cause there was nothing beautiful about the experience whatsoever.  (Thank you...I'll be here all night.) 

I'd advise going down to Giorgio's on the circle for a better NY pizza experience.",-1
"The food is great and so are the strawberry mojitos my favorite but , the service suck. My waiter took forever to come to check on us. We waited to get our check 20 minutes.",-1
"Had the Spring onion soup. Could not eat it. 
Much too salty. Much too spicy hot and I like hot. The General Tso's wings were ok but too much sauce- drenched in sauce. My husband had the pulled mushroom sandwich. Funny taste. Guess we will not be back.  Noise level very very loud too. Sorry to have to write this because we like to patronize local places. They are very busy so I guess we are of a minority opinion",-1
"Take FoxNews off your TVs! They spread nothing but lies and political partisanship. The next time I come into Beefs with my family and that scam is on your TV, I'm walking out and you'll loose $$$.  I hope more people will stand up and make the same suggestion.",-1
"Really thought this place was going to be great. But it appears that the decor is where the ""great"" stops. Gave this place a try couple of weekends ago. Will NOT be going back!  The atmosphere is very pretty but waaaaay too tight, and the cakes LOOK very nice...but that is IT! Nothing to write home about. Spent $25 for 2 slices of cake. The whipped frosting has no flavor and my cake was over baked and dry. Expected way more for the cost. Cheesecake Factory, Flying Cupcake, and Classic Cakes are far superior. I'd even rather have spent $19 for a whole sheetcake from Costco...at least their buttercream icing and cake have by far more flavor! Hopefully, the cake quality improves to mach the decor. Then, it would be worth the 5 star price. For $10-12 for 1 slice of cake, you expect to be blown away, not underwhelmed.",-1
